ABNjjnRY,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Flower Dance,DJ Okawari,Big City Blues,Nancy Faber,78,"There was a sensitivity of tone in Flower Dance, with some considered voicing and balance, supported by effective pedalling, although scope for more rise and fall in the dynamic shaping to fully support the style.  Big City Blues, was jaunty in tempo, though the pulse needed to be more robust with tighter rhythmic motifs at times. Dynamics were contrasted and there was a good sense of the character overall.  There was clear differentiation of musical character in this performance, although more poise and sense of space was possible when moving between the pieces.  A strong sense of communication and involvement in your playing came across - well done."
AKdyEpzx,16-18,Grade 5 and above,ALLA TURCA,W. A. MOZART,IL PORCO ROSSO,JOE HISAISHI,63,"The Rondo Alla Turca was projected with good conviction and a regular pulse was mostly achieved. There was unevenness at times in the semiquavers and quite a few ’splashes’ occurred in the octave work, along with several misdirected notes. Crisper articulations and more energised dynamic contrasts would have added to the characterisation. The final passages slowed somewhat from the initial tempo but you kept the overall flow going and concluded the piece with appropriate vigour.  In ’Il Porco Rosso’ you portrayed the reflective ambience thoughtfully, providing some effective use of rubato. There were a few note slips and rhythmical hesitations along the way, for example in the triplet figures. The flow needed to be more continuous overall, with a more regular underlying pulse, though the melodic line was carefully highlighted and you conveyed a graceful sense of shape within your phrases.  The programme was calmly presented, if needing a little more sense of space in between the items. Though in need of further precision and fluency, there was a clear grasp of the contrasting styles and a commitment to the mood and shape of each piece.  Some enjoyable playing developing - well done and good luck in all your future piano playing."
ANGZVzLJ,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Cloudy Day,Christopher Norton,Sparkling Splashes & Smooth Water,Barbara Arens,75,"There was a reliability of flow in the notes of Cloudy Day although more exploration of softer tones, with scope for bolder dynamic terracing would have supported the narrative. Contrasted articulations and a steady pulse were confidently in place with pedalling mostly effective.  A lively opening tempo and bright tone supported the narrative of the Arens, and although the consistency of pulse fluctuated noticeably between the staccato and legato passages, the tonal colours were vivid and the notes very robust.  There was a good awareness of the contrasting musical characters of your chosen pieces and a sense of poise in the overall pacing of the presentation.  Musical expression and intent was evident in the second piece - well done."
AXQjlaMm,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Musical Clock Spillevaerket,Carl Nielsen,Valse KK IVb Nr. 11,Chopin,67,"A lively tempo suited the style of the Neilsen and the tone was bright to open, with musical details observed, although more clarity in projection would have further animated the narratve. Coordination of the hands often needed to be tighter but a good sense of momentum was maintained.  The Chopin Valse was mostly steady in pulse if initially on the reserved side tempo wise, needing further rhythmic lilt. Dynamic contrast and inparticular more shaping of phrases would have supported the elegance of the style further, but the notes were largely secure.  Reliability of notes and flow were present in this performance with contrast between the styles apparent although needing further vibrancy in detail and more tonal shaping.  A good sense of focus was present in your playing."
AlpvMldm,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Always With Me,Youmi Kimura,Spraymist,W. Carroll,77,"The legato playing in Always with Me was smoothly connected, helping bring a sense of fluidity to the lines. The flow was slightly hurried, needing more poise and control overall to draw out the piece’s mood, and there was scope for more shapely phrasing, though the ending held a more sincere feeling of poise.  Spraymist was rhythmically secure and well-grounded, and as the piece progressed there were moments of flexibility in the flow. A more overarching feeling of phrase and line was needed, and sometimes the passages were a little fragmented, but you achieved a good feeling of ambience at the conclusion.  There was much to commend in the technical delivery, which showed security for much of the time, despite the rushed feel of the opening work. Moments of clear expressive input were conveyed in the second piece, even if overall there was room for more insight and variety in the phrasing, while more time and space at the conclusion of each piece was needed to allow the music to settle and better frame the programme, which was otherwise focused and showed real commitment.  Well done on some fine, tonally sensitive playing!"
AnnZZROw,7-9,Grade 5 and above,"Waltz In A Minor, B.150, Op. Posth",F. Chopin,Fountain In The Rain,William Gillock,89,"The Waltz made effective use of rubato, the melodic line shaped with both tempo and tonal flexibility.  There was scope for further initial fluency to convey the dance style, allthough the triple metre was consistently defined by appropriate articulation in the accompaniment, and although even greater dynamic wudth was possible, the quieter levels only found in the final section, this was accurately and musically played.  'Fountains in the Rain' highlighted melodic notes clearly, and phrase shaping was largely controlled.  The accompanying semiquavers were mostly even, just occasional blemish of evenness in hand alternation occurring, and the programmatic elements of the piece were defined, the cadenza-like passage particularly well managed.  Although dynamic variation was in place, however, there was scope for greater use of the extremes of range, quieter levels in particular needing greater exploration, and some points of slowing were a little too emphatic.  Nevertheless, this was an accurate and characterful account overall.  Your commitment and stylistic engagement were obvious throughout this performance, the contrasts of style defined and with confidence maintained throughout its accurate delivery.  Greater tonal exploration, particularly in terms of quieter levels would have enhanced the contrasts, but the focus evident in your playing could not be faulted.    Many congratulations on this excellent performance and I wish you every success in your future musical ventures."
AoLzrpke,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Pop Corn,Akira Yuyama,Musical Sketch in B flat,Felix Mendelssohn,78,"’Popcorn’ was played with vibrancy and convincing variations of articulation and tonal weight. Even greater dynamic width would have enhanced musical character, particularly at extremes of range, and there were one or two blemishes of evenness and pitch placement towards the end of the middle section. However, the buoyant character was retained, with melodic tone bright and textural balancing generally assured.  The Mendelssohn saw appropriate tonal graduation and wide dynamic contrasts, the melody largely projecting securely at the top of the changing texture. The smoothness of line was not consistently maintained, greater use of the sustaining pedal needed to support legato and harmonic resonance, although despite occasional blemish of pitch centring in the left hand, this was a tonally varied and delicate account.  Confidence of delivery was in this performance, despite occasional blemish, and throughout, you played with focus and stylistic integrity. More warmth of tone in the Mendelssohn would have supported the stylistic contrast, although musical poise was consistent, with focus apparent at all times.  Congratulations on this very good performance, the vibrancy of the first piece a particular highlight. I wish you all the best in your future musical ventures."
AwVaKBPW,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Ballade,Friedrich Burgmuller,Fountain in the Rain,William Gillock,87,"Burgmüller's Ballade was firmly grounded from the outset, and details of accents and articulation vividly brought out the character of the opening passages. There were moments of slight unevenness of tone and rhythm along the way, and there was scope for more nuanced balance at times, but this was largely an assertive account.  Your playing of Fountain in the Rain evoked the musical style effectively, delicately defining the figures, all warmly supported by effective use of the sustaining pedal.  The more florid cadenza-like passages in the middle were particularly compelling, though subsequently there needed more rhythmical regularity to be upheld.  Otherwise this was stylish playing.  You brought flair and poise to the presentation, and a real feeling of performance awareness was communicated.  While rhythmical consistency wasn't fully assured, other elements of the technical delivery showed greater security and confidence, and there was expressive input achieved, especially in the rippling character of the second work.  Congratulations on bringing such strong intensity and involvement to your playing!"
AynZVRKK,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Voyage of the Sampan,Arranged by Charmaine Siagian,My Lady's Ride (Burgmuller op. 100 no. 25),Burgmuller,79,"’Voyage of the Sampan’ had a warm tone and rhythmic accompanying quavers. The main melody was sensitively shaped, but rather overshadowed at times, with pedalling sometimes blurring textures and harmonic changes. Room for a wider dynamic range, particularly quieter playing - though there was some careful shaping. Overall this was fluent and captured the expressive mood.  The Burgmuller had crisp staccato chords and energetic momentum at the start. There were blemishes and untidy moments between parts along the way, with unison passages not consistently coordinated, and some inconsistent phrasing. Slightly unsteady pulse in the final passages, with slower tempo; overall this was reliable and characterful, with varied dynamics.  This was a fluent and well-paced presentation; different styles were communicated with some careful musical details, though dynamic range was often limited, with parts not always carefully balanced. Technical details were mainly secure, apart from slips and untidy moments; overall this was a musical performance.  I particularly liked the bright energy you conveyed in the Burgmuller."
BEzAjZQr,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Intermezzo in A,Johannes Brahms,Night Pieces Part III Stars,Peter Sculthorpe,80,"The Brahms was well sustained and phrasing often had a sense of expressive shape. Glimpses of flexibility coloured shaping, but there was room to highlight more poignant moments with further delicacy. Quieter playing was not always magical enough and accompanying figures sometimes over-dominated the texture. However, hands worked together with confidence most of the time, and the sincerity of the middle section was especially well delivered.   Stars was immediately contrasting in approach and the sustained character was immediately established. The overall dynamic level was rather strong, especially in the first section, and there was scope for further freedom overall. Details of articulation lacked really consistent attention, but the end was carefully paced, with reflective space beyond the final note.  This was a confident performance, showing a good grasp of the different styles. Not all the refined detail was consistently added, and quieter playing tended to be a little strong. There was scope to experiment with flexibility of shaping in both pieces, but a clear feeling of control and enjoyment came across.  Well done. This was a poised and technically assured performance."
BJxOeYDD,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude & Fugue 5 in D major, BWV850",JS Bach,"Rondo (2nd movt fr Sonatina in A major, op.59 no.1)",Friedrich Kuhlau,85,"Bach’s Prelude saw a suitable air of flamboyance, the tempo lively and with much of the fingerwork fluent and even. Further tonal shaping of the line would have enhanced musical direction, and this was similar in the Fugue, where greater tonal variation would have given even stronger definition to the structure. However, tone remained bright, and aside from a few pitch slips in the Fugue, this was confidently played, the counterpoint largely clear.    The vibrancy of the Kuhlau movement was evident from the outset, and clear dynamic contrasts helped to support its musical outline. Although melodic tone remained bright, there was scope for further phrasing and shaping of the figures, and later rushing led to moments of unevenness and blemish in pitch centring in the recapitualtion. However, this was a technically assured rendition overall.    This was a strong performance overall in which you showed clear musical commitment and involvement, suitable time allowed between the two works to enable the styles to settle, and in which overall technical security supported a good degree of accuracy. Even more tonal nuance was possible to enhance outline, although the overall character of each piece was consistently evident.    Congratulations on this excellent performance. I particularly enjoyed the tonal brightness and commitment of your playing and wish you the best for future musical ventures."
BKdJlEmO,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Waltz,Edvard Grieg,Danse du cocher,Jacques Ibert,75,"The left hand provided a clear pulse in the Waltz, and there was variation in articulation. Further rhythmic playfulness and vitality were required, however, and more of the dance element needed to find expression. Although more contrast between the sections of the music was desirable, with some split sounding chords audible, forward flow was sustained, with some variety in dynamics displayed.  Energy was communicated at the start of the Ibert, and there was bounce in the touch. The tone sounded a little rigid and forced when strong accents were played, despite this, and there was room for greater variation between repeated phrases. Further humour and colour awaited capture, but a suitably lively tempo was chosen. There was some effective use of dynamics, as well as the necessary vigour.  An ability to preserve forward flow was a positive factor in this performance, with some contrast achieved between the two chosen works despite both of them being dances. The first item, however, lacked the conviction and vitality of the ’Danse du Cocher’, and poise in the stage presentation was weakened by the brief one-note false start at the beginning, and by leaving the hands collapsed on the keyboard at one point. Good variety in articulation and dynamics was conveyed, nonetheless, with use of the pedal adding warmth and dimension to the sound, and the pulse retained focus.  There were encouraging moments of buoyancy and spontaneity captured in your playing, with some rich sounds drawn from the bass of the piano. Keep up the good work!"
BZAQwvKZ,7-9,Grade 5 and above,Träumerei,R.Schumann,O polichinelo,Villa-Labos,77,"Expressive shaping and use of rubato gave character to the Schumann.  There was scope for greater movement forwards at times, the tempo just a little too reserved, and although the sustained style was found, unnecessary harmonic blurring occurred on occasion.  However, textural balancing favoured the melody, and the quieter dynamic levels were well controlled.    The vivacity of 'O polichinelo' was in place, and use of a wide dynamic range gave this a sense of excitement.  Evenness was not consistent, however, despite the accuracy of the playing, with hand alternation and voicing sometimes compromised, and with scope for even greater musical detail.  Nonetheless, you played this with clear enthusiasm, the overall character of the music evident.    The contrasting styles were clearly defined, the pacing of the programme well judged, and throughout the performance, you played with enthusiasm and conviction.  The extremes of tempo used did have an effect on musical outline and technique on occasion, but stylistic engagement and accuracy were consistent.    Well done on this very good performance.  I particularly enjoyed the contrasts you made in your playing."
BZgQrmAd,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op.3, No.2",Sergei Rachmaninoff,Indigo Moon,Elissa Milne,88,"A bold opening statement in the Prelude gave a sense of presence, and the octaves were given tonal depth. The chords were not always quite placed together as the piece progressed, but the notes were in place. The contrasting sections were effectively managed and the more lyrical middle had apt phrase shaping and expressive detailing. The technical delivery was largely secure and the performance was assertive and musically aware.   Indigo Moon began gently and at a suitable steady and restrained tempo. The melodic line was given tonal warmth and projection and the chords were mostly reliable. There were some overly strident tones as the account progressed, and also some occasional missed notes. The pulse was suitably fluid though, and the style was well portrayed.   A live spoken introduction would have enhanced the overall sense of performance, as would a final ackowledgment at the end of the presentation. The playing was musical and accomplished though, and held a clear sense of outward communication, with an air of authority at times. Super!"
BZkZoxKl,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Venetianisches Gondelied,Felix Mendelssohn,Indigo Moon,Elissa Milne,78,"A pleasing lilt was created at the start of the Mendelsson and described the movement of the gondola effectively. The chords were not always placed together, and the legato was not fully maintained. The melodic line was given projection though, and there were signs of contouring and dynamic colour. The contrast in articulation was evident but a greater sense of the legato and of flow would have been welcome. however, the technical delivery was reliable and rhythmic outlines remained poised.  The tempo was suitably restrained and relaxed at the start of Indigo Moon and the rhythmic patterns were evident, yet relaxed. The chords were not always placed together, but the melodic line had projection and some tonal warmth. The rubato styling was graded sensitively and the dynamic range was apt in this expressive and communicative interpretation.  The chosen pieces were suitably contrasting and the presentation showed stylish awareness. The technical delivery was largely secure, though a little more tonal refinement would have been welcome in the first piece. Indigo Moon was particularly engaging and subtle, and also well controlled.   Congratulations on a very good and communicative presentation."
BdmjLXKg,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Sonata No.11 Op.22 (1st Movement),Beethoven,Etude Op.10 No.4,Chopin,96,"A bright and spirited opening in the Beethoven gave a clear sign of technical facility and finger agility. The semiquavers were mostly even, if not always fully defined, and the hands were balanced and coordinated. An assortment of tonal qualities were found and more lyrical passages had a fitting cantabile. The articulation styles were suitably varied and the detailing was committed in this exciting and dramtic account. The playing held an air of authority and the technical delivery was secure and accomplished.  The Chopin was also played at a very brisk tempo and showed considerable technical accomplishment. The overall contouring was clearly portrayed with a broad overview in the interpretation. The finer detailing was also well observed and the playing was rousing with touches of brilliance. Super!  Whilst there was a contrast in the Periods of the pieces both demonstrated your considerable finger agility, and similarities in the quick tempi adopted. However, there were touches of lyricism and tonal exploration in the Beethoven, and this was a very engaging and stunning performance overall. The playing was outward and assertive, with a clear sense of musical authority and performance awareness. Congratulations on this outstanding and most enjoyable presentation. Bravo!"
BlQReZXd,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Spiritoso,Muzio Clementi,The Village In May,Joe Hisaishi,70,"The Clementi had a well chosen tempo and examples of crisp fingerwork. Extra sparkle and evenness in the longer semiquaver running passages were possible, along with a more subdued accompaniment. Dynamic variety buoyed up the playing, and the classical style was targeted, though a subtler gradation of tone could have further captured its vivacious spirit. A confident and decisive appearance won through.  The Village in May had a suitably cheerful personality and good accuracy, with a firmly established tempo and largely coordinated hands. It needed additional lightness and variety of touch, to more fully capture the daintier areas of the music, but there was a good level of consistency and character to it.  The two pieces contrasted well and achieved clear style identities. A few extra seconds of repose between items could have further enhanced the performance, and even greater technical ease was possible. The best areas of the playing sprang to life well, and with extra ingenuity in regard to contrasts.  Congratulations on this very good performance, and best wishes for the future!"
BmrPygXx,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Moderato,attrib.Ludwig van Beethoven,The Singing Swan,Alexis Ffrench,82,"There was effective clarity in the detail of the articulation of Beethoven’s Moderato, and you paced this well. Greater flexibility of phrase and line was possible, and sometimes the left-hand accompaniment needed more nuanced balance, but this flowed evenly and gently throughout.  The Singing Swan by Ffrench was sensitively defined and there was commendable control upheld in the rhythmic flow. The phrasing tended to lack variety, with missed opportunities for expressive shape being present, but the tone was projected with sensitivity.  You brought a feeling of poise and commitment to your playing and there was a strong overall sense of performance awareness conveyed. More expressive insight needed to be communicated, particularly through pliable phrasing, but the technical delivery was secure and well-grounded.  Congratulations on bringing such reliable control to your excellent performance!"
BpgXQmwO,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Ticklin' Toes,Florence B. Price,Moment Musical in F minor,Schubert,89,"The bright and buoyant character of Ticklin’ Toes was clear at the start through the clean lines and use of articulation. This moved with a robust sense of pulse, though there was scope for this to take a more brisk tempo, and for the lines to be even more energised, though the dynamic involvement was confident and engaging. Notes were secure in pitch throughout.  Strong and purposeful, the Schubert was well controlled in relation to tone and texture. There were some communicative stylistic nuances present, as well as some organised dynamic contrasts, but there was scope for the variation between the forte and pianissimo playing to be even more vivid. This was technically assured throughout, with the performance itself spirited and positive.  There was a strong sense of poise and control during this performance, with the different musical characters of the pieces confidently conveyed. Although there was scope for the dynamic involvement to be more vivid, and to explore a wider range of tonal sonorities, the performances were still expressive and communicative, with the technical demands assured throughout.  This was an excellent performance - I particularly enjoyed the sensitive shaping of the second piece, and how the phrases were given space to breathe. Thank you for playing."
BxzWPMGW,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella Twist,Victoria Proudler,The Muppet Show Theme,Jim Henson and Sam Pottle,79,"Tarantella Twist had assured momentum at a lively pace, with clear projection of the dynamic details. Not all the LH quavers were evenly controlled and there was an occasional smudge in clarity but the playing had a confident fluency.  A bright tone and lift in the staccato detail supported the character of The Muppet Show Theme. A firm pulse was not fully sustained through the middle section and the melodic line could have been more clearly projected but notes were very assured.  There was a poise in this performance, and although more sense of engagement with the character of each piece was possible, the contrast in character of the chosen pieces came across.  A sense of focus and conviction in this performance was well sustained."
DLpoPbeM,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Idylle,Cecile Chaminade,Ticklin' Toes,Florence B.Price,82,"Idyll had a gently lilting tempo, which helped capture the reflective mood, and pedalling was efficient, if not always wholly discreet. There was room for further direction in the phrasing and for a more singing approach to the melody, but the style of the music was consistently delivered.   There was plenty of energy in both the tempo and rhythmic approach in Ticklin’ Toes, and the relaxed style was clearly enjoyed. There were a few less restrained right hand bars in the second half, and room for even more diligent observation of the finer musical detail. However, much of this swung along with freedom.  This was a carefully paced performance, with good use of time between pieces. The different musical styles were understood and delivered with consistent detail, though there was scope for further dynamic colour overall and exploration of accents in the second piece. Your enjoyment, though, was obvious, and was shared.  Well done-I especially enjoyed the energy and rhythmic purpose of Ticklin’ Toes."
DOkyZwKO,7-9,Up to Grade 5,King for a Day!: From Magic Beans.,Ben Crosland,The Elephant Herd: from Safari.,June Armstrong,81,"You opened your performance with a sturdy performance of King for a Day! and there was robust rhythmical control upheld throughout. There was scope for more variety in the phrasing, as well as nuanced balance between the theme and accompaniment, but note accuracy was guaranteed and you brought out a feeling for the music’s character.  The Elephant Herd was weighty and well-grounded, and one could sense the descriptive quality of the music through the firm tonal projection and precise articulation. The phrasing lacked full flexibility, and there was space for more energetic impetus overall, but there was a decisive feeling of style present.  Both works had a similar sense of character, but you brought these out effectively, even if more expressive input was possible in the phrasing. Nonetheless the articulation was spirited, and commendable technical control was always maintained.  Congratulations on your confident performance, and on such a poised sense of presentation throughout!"
DXJAplrA,13-15,Grade 5 and above,SONATA IN D,D. SCARLATTI,IMPROMPTU IN B MINOR,SAMUEL COLERIDGE-TAYLOR,78,"The Scarlatti featured crisp articulation and mostly tidy coordination, if at a slightly conservative tempo for this vibrant ’Allegro’ movement. Whilst there was a need for a little more forward impetus to drive the phrases with greater energy, there were effective and appropriate contrasts in dynamic to bring it variety. For the most part the ornamentation was neatly integrated into the pulse and the clear and resolute tone was well suited to the idiom.  The Impromptu followed the dynamic contours carefully and the opening was gracefully shaped. Mistimed changes of pedal caused a few small blurs of harmony but the melodic line was well highlighted in the minor key passage. At the change of tonality to D major the tempo flagged a little and the phrasing became more static. The spread chords were neatly negotiated, with just the occasional minor note blemish occurring. Overall there was scope for further expressive intensity but it was a well-controlled performance otherwise, showing respect for much of the detail of the composer’s writing.  You presented the programme in a calm and professional manner, if needing to remain still for a little longer at the piano before switching to the second piece. The technical aspect of the playing showed a good level of accuracy in both notes and rhythm, with tidy articulation where appropriate. Pedalling occasionally created smudges of harmony but melodic lines were usually clear in definition. The contrasts between the two styles were well grasped, with a firm sense of pulse underpinning the Scarlatti and some thoughtful phrase-shaping in the more lyrical work, albeit with room for more free-flowing tempi at times to enhance the depth of expressive detail. Nevertheless it was a cohesive and well-committed performance.  I enjoyed your performances very much - well done and good luck in all your future musical endeavours!"
DZaJOyGr,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Sonatina Op. 36 No. 3,Muzio Clementi,Prelude I in C Major,Johann Sebastian Bach,74,"Clementi’s Sonatina was energised in tempo and rhythmic approach, and details of articulation were often vibrant. Hands worked efficiently together much of the time, though not all semiquavers were under rigorously even control, and there was room for a wider range of tonal colour. Moments of instability impacted trills and cadences, but most were quickly resolved.  You chose a suitably fluid tempo for Bach’s Prelude in C, which was quite well maintained, despite unevenness of right hand semiquavers and a slight tendency to rush. There was scope for further direction in the melody, and missing bars (due to time restraints) caused unusual harmonic progressions in the middle section. This was carefully sustained though, with a clear feeling of the reflective mood.  This was a contrasting performance, with a sense of occasion, and with sufficient space between pieces. There were some technical challenges in the Clementi, and keeping all semiquavers under strict control was not quite achieved. The Bach flowed quite freely, despite harmonic irregularities and a slight inclination to rush. You played with purpose and with some added musical detail.  This was a colourful and determined performance, well done."
DkYJamjG,7-9,Up to Grade 5,ALLEGRO,SHINICHI SUZUKI,THE MOONS OF JUPITER,NANCY FABER,86,"A very assured control of pulse underpinned the Allegro, with clear projection of the musical details and very secure notes, although the melody needed further projection in the softest playing.  There was always a sense of poise and control in the playing of The Moons of Jupiter, with an atmospheric stillness in the opening phrases, although the LH needed to be even more ""hushed"" in the balance. The final stages explored the drama of the dynamics and keyboard range very confidently with some effective pacing.  This was a communicative performance with the bold contrast of character between the chosen pieces very convincingly conveyed.  A very enjoyable programme, with plenty of expressive musical detail – an excellent performance."
DnaRnKjn,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Sparkling Splashes & Smooth Water,Barbara Arens,Cloudy Day,Christopher Norton,73,"The Arens was played with a positive tone and at a lively tempo. Clearer contrast in dynamics was possible and more of the tempo directions, but the staccato detail had clarity and the notes were largely assured.  There was a crisp lift to the staccato if the tone was rather bold for the softer passages in Cloudy Day, such as the opening. Overall there was a much wider range of dynamics to explore, and there was the odd note slip, but the pedalling was mostly effective with some sense of the narrative present.  This performance showed a good sense of commitment and conviction. Although there was more to discover in the musical detail to really elucidate the narrative of each piece, there was a confidence in the fluency, and all by memory.  Musical intent was evident in your playing - well done."
DxZjRmOE,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Sleeping Beauty - Sipkova Ruzenka,Ivana Loudova,Get in step,Christopher Norton,83,"There was a rhythmic lilt at this elegant tempo for Sleeping Beauty, with a reliable pulse and secure notes. More contrast in the softer tones was possible but there was clear attention to much of the detail.   The pulse was firm and brisk in the Norton, with carefully balanced hands and lively energy in the articulations.   An assured feel to this performance, all securely memorised with poise in the overall pacing and the contrasting musical characters of the pieces clearly conveyed, although more nuances of style to explore in the first piece.   I particularly enjoyed the rhythmic energy and conviction in your playing of Get in Step - well done."
EAVMBedo,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Divertimento in G Major, Hob : XVI : G1, 1st movement",J. Haydn,Waltz Op.64 No.1,F. Chopin,94,"The Haydn was played with appropriate energy and attack, revealing a full array of contrasts as it progressed. Phrasing had clear shape and structure and there was a spontaneity to the playing which gave the account a playful character. Occasionally the cadence points hurried with some small smudges but otherwise the piece had sparkling and controlled fingerwork.  In the Chopin the pace was suitably judged and the waltz was able to dance with freedom from the outset. Throughout, expressive elements were deployed to add contrast and excitement; this was authoritative playing which fully caught the spirit of the piece.  The composer’s intentions were always at the fore in these intelligent readings and the presentation was calmly paced.  Outstanding playing here, I enjoyed the sense of fun and communication throughout."
EDLqDNVD,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude in C sharp minor: No. 10 from 24 preludes, Op. 81",Stephen Heller,"Venetianisches Gondellied: No. 6 from Lieder ohne Worte, Op. 19b",Felix Mendelssohn,79,"Tonal delicacy gave the Prelude character, fingerwork even in the semiquaver movement. There were moments of tonal shaping, although even greater tracing of the line was possible, with further dynamic width needed, particularly at extremes of range, However, the piece was accurately played with consistency of pulse and technical assurance in place.  The Mendelssohn captured the lilt of the style from the outset, the accompaniment given appropriate tonal graduation to support the compound metre. Although smoothly played, further tonal projection of the melody was possible, and greater dynamic contrast was needed to give the piece full programmatic character, despite its appropriate contrasts of articulation and overall accuracy.  Throughout the performance, you played with grace and poise, the contrasting styles of the pieces defined through variation of articulation. Exploration of a wider dynamic range would have enhanced musical characterisation, but the accuracy of the playing was a highlight.  Congratulations on this very good performance which showed clear technical security. I wish you the best for your future musical ventures."
EGGOMwJa,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"French Suite No.5 in G major, BWV 816 VII. Gigue",J.S. Bach,Liebestraum No. 3 in A-flat major,Franz Liszt,95,"Bach’s Gigue danced with unrelenting energy from the start, and dialogue between hands was both imaginative and agile. Dynamics added colour and there was a lovely feeling of building shape. The end was especially conclusive.   Expressive ideas were quickly on show in Liszt’s Liebestraum, and a flexible approach to phrasing highlighted more luxurious harmonic moments. Balance between parts was often confidently managed, allowing the melody to sing with freedom. There was a very occasional smudge in more complex passages, but this was a sensitive and controlled performance, with an instinctive grasp of both styles.  This was a poised and spacious performance, showing a mature and instinctive grasp of both pieces. Technical demands were effortlessly met, leaving space to communicate your imaginative musical thoughts.  Congratulations. This was an outstanding performance. Best wishes for future success and enjoyment."
EJaJLlQV,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Solfeggietto in C minor, H. 220 Wq. 117:2",C. P. E. Bach,Fountain in the Rain,William Gillock,82,"Even management of tone gave a lovely sense of legato to much of the Bach. Rhythmically it could have been even more tidy; some semiquavers less evenly placed, mainly in the arpeggiated figures. Right hand material was generally less neat and projected in the second half, but you kept the flow despite some catching of adjacent keys, finding the notes assuredly overall, at an apt pace and with varied detail.  The Gillock had a colourful opening, with the quieter parts of the piece particularly effective in this sense. It needed further sonority to communicate the musical idea more vividly, especially around the cadenza and in the louder parts thereafter. Caught keys slightly impacted the harmonic effect in the left hand ornaments later on, with the larger intervals not as seamlessly incorporated in the latter stages too. Regardless, it still remained fluent as a whole and was effectively balanced.  Committed playing, with a genuine sense of engagement with the music communicated in the most assured parts of the Gillock. More confident management of faster rhythms and louder playing would have brought further musical clarity to both pieces. They were, nevertheless, clearly stylised, the contrasting sound-worlds well differentiated.  Well done! Overall this was an excellent performance which demonstrated your varied and admirable musical skills. I wish you well on your future musical endeavours!"
EQYwKrXv,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella Twist,Victoria Proudler,Always with Me,"Youmi Kimura, Wakako Kaku",82,"The first piece began with a bold tone, and the hands worked well together. Phrases moved with a sense of direction, lines were contoured, and the there was some effective control of the pedal. Hands needed tighter control in the soft section, and there was scope for the shaping to be even more vibrant and persuasive, but notes were reliable in relation to pitch and were confidently projected throughout.  The calm nature of Always with Me was evident from the start, with smooth lines and a well balanced texture. There was room to explore the expressive components of the character more persuasively, using a wider range of tonal sonorities, particularly within the softer dynamic parts, though the articulation within the second section was crisp and buoyant, with the playing overall secure.  There was a clear sense of pacing between the individual items, as well as poise and control during the playing. The pieces were well contrasted and created an appropriate mood, though there was room for even more vibrant and vivid portrayal overall. The technical demands of the programme were largely well met.  I particularly enjoyed the bold and confident start in Tarantella Twist! It felt like you really enjoyed playing this one too!"

Harris",John Williams,72,"There was a confident flow of notes in the Beethoven with a very robust pulse sustained. Tone was firm, however more dynamic shaping and careful tapering of the phrases would have enhanced the elegance of this style.  Hedwig’s Theme had a clear tone and fluency. Although a more lyrical sense of line, shape and dynamic flexibility was possible to support musical mood, the pedal-work was effective and a legato flow sustained.  A sense of performance was present with good fluency. Further poise was needed at the conclusion of the playing, and there were more nuances of style to explore to highlight the contrasting musical genres, but the notes were very assured.  There was a clear sense of focus in your performance today - Well done."
EVodkXkN,7-9,Up to Grade 5,The Song of Twilight,Yoshinao Nakada,The Spanish Guitar,William Gillock,88,"There was a delicacy of tone colour overall in Song of Twilight, despite occasional lapses in control of tone and effective balance. The pulse pushed onwards at times, however the melodic line was clearly conveyed and there was sensitivity in the dynamic contrasts, with poise in the overall pacing.  A lively tempo and clear grasp of the rhythmic character were strengths in The Spanish Guitar with a clarity in the most of the triplet figures. Musical detail was largely very well realised and although there were some lapses in balance and tone control this was a spirited and energetic performance.  You clearly understood the contrasting characters of your chosen pieces and there was always a sense of involvement and of communication in your performance.  I really enjoyed the vibrant musical detail of The Spanish Guitar - an excellent performance."
EdXEMzXj,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Spilleværket,Carl Nielsen ( 1865-1931 ),Piano Sonate No.15 K.545 1st Mov.,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,68,"Nielsen’s Spillevaerket was immediately energised in tempo and the playful character was captured. Keeping a really firm grip on all triplets and longer passages of semiquavers was a growing challenge from the middle, and there were a few note errors at cadence points. However, lapses of momentum were quickly resolved and some of the musical detail was sparkling.   There was plenty of determination in Mozart’s Allegro, though the opening tempo was a little reserved, and there were a growing number of coordination challenges to overcome. Ornaments caused unevennss and semiquavers in both hands were rarely under complete control. However, the style and shape of the music was fiercely protected, and some of the articulation was crisp and consistent.  This was a purposeful performance, with a grasp of both musical styles. and some consistent refined detail. Techncial demands were not always comfortably met, especially in the Mozart, and there were lapses of both rhythmic stability and coordination to negotiate. However, stylistic input was often clear, and mishaps were resiliently dealt with.  Well done. This was an energised performance, and challenges were bravely overcome."
EjxWgXJw,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Swan Lake,Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,Dynamite,David Stewart and Jessica Agombar,70,"The tempo was well chosen, with forward flow achieved. Uneven fast figures in the left hand were audible, however, with the accompaniment too dominant and heavy which negated the essential gracefulness. Untidy co-ordination featured, with further poetry and expression desirable. Some buoyancy was captured, nonetheless, and the right hand possessed a bright tone.  'Dynamite' was approached with energy, and the left hand accompaniment provided a clear pulse. Control and clarity were not always displayed in the fast repeated notes, despite this, with the interpretation sounding rather one-coloured. Although further shape and detail were necessary, some of the essential vigour was communicated, together with variation in articulation.  There was an ability to sustain forward flow in the playing, though more grace and lyricism in the first item would have provided the required contrast between the two pieces. Technical control was not always secure, with greater variation in dynamics needed to support the expressive shaping of melodies and phrases. A deeper engagement in the music and subject matter was desirable, but energy and buoyancy were conveyed. Clarity was mostly preserved in the tone, with a good range of articulation featured, and tempo choices proved reliable.  This was a lively presentation, with plenty of bounce and vigour. Enjoy exploring the world of piano music!"
EvmrKXqv,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Sunsets in Sabannah,Randall Hartsell,L'arabesque,Johann Friedrich Franz Burgmüller,91,"Sunsets in Savannah was sensitive and well controlled from the start, creating smooth lines, balanced textures and contoured phrasing. An appropriate atmosphere was created and sustained, with the pedal work largely focused. Whilst there was scope to explore a wider range of tonal sonorities, developing the lyrical components of the character even more, the performance was expressive and communicative.  The Burgmuller began with clean, crisp chords, and the playful character was well captured. Phrases moved with effective dynamic direction and the rhythmic components were incisive and clean, only needing greater control and clarity when the semiquavers were in the left hand line and moving in unison. The playing was committed and passionate.  This was an assured performance, which was fluent and authoritative throughout. A strong sense of poise and control was on display, and the different characters of the pieces were vibrant and purposeful, only occasionally needing more expressive and idiomatic portrayal. Some loss of clarity, but this was short-lived, with the technical demands of the programme well met.  An exceptional and communicative performance overall - well done!"
GElyNWnV,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Impromptu Op.142 No.3 ""Rosamunde"" - Theme",Franz Schubert,The Village in May,Joe Hisaishi,83,"The elegance of the Schubert was sensed, with some of the essential cantabile realised. Even so, more detail and a little more rhythmic vitality were possible, and the melody needed to sing with further expression. Finer shaping of the pattern in the left hand accompaniment was desirable, though changes in tempo were well-graded. Sensitivity was apparent, with the touch natural and unforced.  A playful mood and bright tone were realised from the start in ’The Village in May’. Syncopated and swing rhythms supported the fun and humour in the music, though even bolder contrast was possible in places, together with a wider range of colour. Technical demands were met, nonetheless, with the staccato chord on the left-hand’s off-beat accompaniment precise and possessing the necessary lift.  Confident forward flow characterised these interpretations, with delicate colours and rhythmic vitality displayed. Even so, there was room for even finer detail in the phrasing, as well as greater contrast and variation between repeated material and the sections of the music to give the playing total conviction. The touch was never forced or harsh, nonetheless, with some poetry and subtlety communicated, and the opening and changing tempo choices were well judged and focused.  You have the ability to express humour and playfulness in the music, together with touches of poetry, to create a most enjoyable performance. Congratulations!"
GNgQeMXb,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Sonatina in C major, Op.36 No. 3 (First Movement, Spiritoso)",Muzio Clementi,Galop Final,Alfredo Casella,83,"The Clementi began with a bright tone and assured tempo; the melody was projected at first, though not consistently, with more careful balance and coordination between parts often needed. Quick melodic passages were fluid and rhythmic, apart from isolated blemishes - though these sometimes lacked clarity. The pulse rather rushed at times, increasingly as it progressed, particularly in sequential passages. Scope for more stylistic lightness and wider dynamic variety, especially quieter playing; but there was confident energy and focus throughout.  The Casella was bold, with determined momentum and rhythmic accompanying quavers. The melody had cheerful rhythmic energy, with fluid flourishes; parts were not consistently coordinated, with some rhythm patterns rather rushed. Both parts needed much more lightness and clarity - and wider dynamic variety; but there was characterful assurance and direction through to the end.  This was a confident performance, with different musical styles communicated effectively. Thoughtful stylistic phrasing in both pieces, but dynamic range was limited, with much lighter, quieter playing often needed; technical details were mainly secure, apart from a few blemishes and untidy moments - and rather hurried pulse at times. Overall reliable continuity and direction here.  I particularly enjoyed the confident musical energy you conveyed in both pieces."
GQDAAGxx,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Alla Turca,W.A. Mozart,Under the Dreaming Cherry Tree,Eri Kiyama,83,"’Alla Turca’ started with a light and clear tone which was maintained across the course of the piece. Semiquavers were evenly played for the majority, their articulation precise, and most of the wider dynamic contrasts were defined. The quieter playing in the episodes saw small blemishes of evenness, and pitch centring in the octaves was not consistently secure, with some confidence lost towards the end. However, the overall character of the music was maintained, and musical variation was apparent throughout.  ’Under the Dreaming Cherry Tree’ saw a suitably delicate melodic tone, and for the majority, the hand balance was well controlled, allowing the melody to sing. Dynamic contrasts were evident, although there was scope for greater control of tonal graduation and phrasing, with even more flexibility of both tone and tempo needed to enhance the expressive character. Nevertheless, although the central section saw some harmonic blurring and slips of technical control, the outer sections saw appropriate simplicity and poise, with overall playing accurate.  This was a controlled and poised performance, with your focus maintained throughout and with the contrasts of style clearly defined. Further dynamic width and tonal control would have added to the musical shaping, but musical intention was clear throughout.  Congratulations on this excellent performance. I particularly enjoyed the delicacy of your second piece, and I wish you all the best for your future musical ventures."
GVjqPKEW,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Swans and Ducks,Fanny Waterman & Marion Harewood,The Waltz of the Toads,Kerstin Strecke,66,"Swans and Ducks was taken at a suitable tempo and flowed well, with notes and rhythms all securely in place. There was room for a more fluid legato and some musical shaping in the LH to bring the music to life, and the chords could have been a little less prominent in order to allow the melody to be more fully projected, but the RH was crisply articulated and, despite a little hurrying towards the end, the tempo was otherwise maintained.  Waltz of the Toads began well, with the articulation crisp and the tempo well chosen. There was a tendency to hurry as the piece went on, and scope to explore the opportunities for dynamic contrast, but notes and rhythms were otherwise in place, with something of the character conveyed.  Pacing and sequencing were thoughtfully managed in this performance of two effectively contrasted pieces. Characterisation drew largely on the cleanly detached articulation, with room to incorporate dynamic contrasts and a sense of shape in the phrasing. Tempi were not always maintained, but delivery was otherwise accurate and controlled.  I enjoyed your performance - well done!"

The melody was projected at first, though not consistently, with much lighter staccato and clearer ornaments needed - and scope for more sustained legato melodic lines. There was some careful dynamic shaping here, with characterful momentum overall.  The Benda flowed reliably, with a confident tone and neatly coordinated parts. The melody was projected, with mainly secure control - though there were some blemishes and rhythmic inaccuracies. Dynamics were thoughtfully shaped, with steady and reliable flow; scope for bolder forward direction, but there was some stylistic melodic clarity here.  This was a fluent performance, with effective transitions between different styles, and some careful phrasing and dynamic shaping. Technical details were mainly secure, apart from a few slips and untidy moments; overall reliable continuity and some thoughtful details here.  I particularly liked the stylistic lightness you achieved in the Benda."
GXYNoypr,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Invention No 8 in F Major, BWV779",J.S.Bach,Love Theme,Catherine Rollin,85,"The first piece began with clean, crisp lines and the hands worked well together, with phrases arching and well articulated. Occassionally there was scope for even tighter rhythmic control and for the playing to be even more vibrant. A few moments where tone needed more nourishment in the left hand, but otherwise this was an engaging and positive performance.  The Love Theme was soft, smooth and sincere from the start. Lines were arching and expressive, with the pedal well controlled. Tone was sometimes clipped and right hands notes needed to be even more tightly coordinated in parts. There was a strong sense of cohesion overall and phrases flowed well.  This was an assured performance, where textures were well managed and lines confidently projected. The different musical identities of the pieces came across mostly effectively, just leaving room for even more vivid portrayal. There was some inconsistency of tone control and the need for tighter rhythmic coordiation in parts, but otherwise the technical demands of the programme were largely well met.  Thank you for playing - I really enjoyed the strong sense of poise, as well as the energy of the first piece. Well done."
GXggDkKV,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Springtime In My Heart,Martha Mier,Tarantelle,Burgmuller,78,"Springtime in my Heart had a flowing tempo, allowing semiquavers plenty of momentum. This was played with resilient dialogue between hands and with controlled pedalling, though there was room for futher expressive direction in the phrasing overall. Softer playing was a little strong at times, but the end was especially well paced.   The Tarantella danced from the first note, at an excitingly ambitious tempo. Keeping all triplet quavers under control was a persistent challenge, causing moments of breathless and disorganised dialogue, and there was a tendency to clip rests. However, musical intentions were clear and were delivered with determination.  This was a poised and carefully paced performance, which explored two contrasting musical styles. There was room for even more refined musical detail, and faster playing was not fully controlled in the Tarantella. However, your enjoyment and sense of accomplishment was obvious and was shared.  Well done, this was spirited and determined playing."
GbDYQNWE,13-15,Grade 5 and above,SONATA in C,Mozart,Moment Musicaux No.3,Schubert,90,"The Mozart was stylishly presented, with poise and shape underpinning the passagework and phrasing in both hands. This revealed strong engagement and understanding of the nuanced detail, and this was supported by largely very adept playing and technical security. There was some untidiness where rhythms moved between the hands, not disruptive to continuity but with scope for a little more firmness in the pulse and rhythmic clarity. Dynamic range was sufficiently wide to allow purposeful direction, though there was room for a little more lightness at times. Emphasis provided very compelling ends to key sections.   The light, juanty character of the Schubert came across well, thanks to detached, even left-hand detail which underpinned a well sustained pulse. Notes were securely in place and tempo was judged well, so that the playing was clear and intricate in detail, though there was scope to find opportunities for greater lyricism and shape in the melody line. The closing section was particularly poised, with good tonal control underpinning the voicing of the final chords.   This was an assured performance and the characteristics of the two pieces came across very well. There was a need to make more of the lyrical aspect of the Schubert, to set it in starker contrast against the Mozart, but the intricacies of the technical detail of each piece were clearly and adeptly projected. There was effective and positive direction, with tidy articulation and focused emphasis, and tonal balance between the hands was very well managed.   Well done indeed! I enjoyed hearing your performance very much, and you demonstrated much musical insight and technical security in these two pieces. I wish you continued fulfilment in your piano studies."
GexazVyR,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Lightly Row,Franz Wiedemann,Forest Song,Nancy and Randall Faber,68,"Lightly Row was played at a suitable tempo with notes and rhythms securely in place. There was room to make more of the contrasts in articulation, with some of the RH needing to be more legato and scope to lighten the staccato notes, particularly in the LH, but this otherwise flowed well.  Forest Song was confidently presented, with the rests accurately counted and notes all in place, although the RH in the middle section was played an octave higher than written. More could have been made of the contrasts in articulation, with a smoother RH sometimes needed, and opportunities to explore the dynamic contrasts were not always taken, despite a sensitively managed ending.  This was an engaging performance, effectively delivered, although there was room to take just a little more time at the end of the first piece before turning the page to locate the second. More could have been made of the contrasts in character between the two pieces, with room to draw on a wider range of dynamics and articulation, and to vary the tone colour, but all was securely delivered.  A committed and enjoyable performance - well done."
GkYWKRYE,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Sparkling Splashes and Smooth Water,Barbara Arens,A Little Song,D. B. Kabalevsky,76,"The tempo was sprightly and there was energy in the mostly crisp staccato detail of the Arens. More vibrancy in the dynamic contrast and further tempo detail would have added character but the notes were very assured.   The melodic line was well projected in A Little Song and the notes were reliable. Softer tonal colours and more expressive shaping would have supported the initial gentle mood but the ending was sensitively realised.   There was a clear sense of performance in this presentation with attention to most of the musical detail, if more nuances of character to explore at times. A strong sense of conviction in the flow was sustained.  Well done on an assured and focused performance."
Gpjdzzya,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Study in F,Duvernoy,Angelfish,Gaudet,74,"Articulation achieved variety in the study, with the pulse defined. The approach was rather one-coloured, however, with more detail possible in the phrasing. Although greater contrast between the sections was desirable, with minor hesitation audible, forward flow was sustained, with the tempo lively.  Delicate colours were explored, and use of the pedal supported this watery world of the angelfish. The fast figures in the accompaniment needed more shape and expression, despite this, as well as a lighter, more flexible touch to avoid competition with the melody. There was a brief lapse in focus at one point, but the tone remained natural and unforced, with some soft dynamics realised.  Tempo choices were well judged, with sufficient contrast in colour and mood between the two pieces displayed. Even so, technical control was not always reliable, and there was scope for deeper engagement in the music and subject matter. Sufficient flow was realised, and a clear tone featured, together with a little poetry in places.  There were some really effective changes of dynamic captured in your playing that were exciting to hear. Keep going and well done!"
GvPQMAdo,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Bach Invention in D minor,BWV 775,Adagietto Pianissimo,Alberto Ginastera,67,"The Invention was played with many stylistically appropriate features and generally flowed along steadily. A number of slips did occur as it progressed though and trills were not wholly integrated into the lines, often marring the direction. Some musical phrase shaping helped propel the account to a neat close.  The gentle atmosphere of the Ginastera was beautifully caught with use of a soft tone and well-controlled pedal. Rhythmically this could have been more precise however, particularly at the start and a more flowing line would have enhanced the tonal ambience.  A carefully presented programme there was some feel for the differing moods of the pieces, if not fully controlled in execution.  I especially enjoyed the sensitve approach to the Adagietto. Well done on some good playing."
JKKQPBpz,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Pyramids at Night,Nancy Faber and Randall Faber,A Morning Sunbeam,Florence B. Price,69,"The contrast in articulation between RH and LH in Pyramids at Night was effectively managed and the tempo was apt, capturing the character of this atmospheric piece. There was room to explore more of the rise and fall in the shape of some of the RH phrases, but dynamic contrasts added a little colour. Not all rhythms were secure, with crotchets occasionally played as quavers, causing instablity in the pulse, but pitches were accurately found.  A Morning Sunbeam was taken at a lively pace and played with energy throughout, despite a little slowing in the middle section. There was room to ensure that the important melodic material was consistenly projected from the texture and given more of a sense of shape, and there were a few rhythmically imprecise moments, but notes were accurately found throughout and the character conveyed overall.  This was a committed performance, effectively projected and communicated, although there was room for a little more stillness at the end of the first piece to allow the mood to settle and make more of the contrast with the second. There could have been more rhythmic precision in the delivery, but something of each of the styles was conveyed through colourful contrasts in dynamics and articulation.  I enjoyed your performance of these two contrasted pieces."
JMlVYLnw,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Sonate No.8 ""Pathetique"" Opus 13 3rd Movement",Ludwig Van Beethoven,Trepac Danse Russe (from the Nutcracker),Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,80,"The Beethoven was played with elegance of phrasing and much all round vitality. Whilst the highlighting of harmonic changes was not unwelcome, the use of rubato became rather excessive in the context of the style, with a more robust underlying pulse being needed. There were a few note and chordal deviations, eg in some of the more rapid passagework, but the crisp and well-varied articulations added character and buoyancy. At times the swells in tone were overstated but the musical intentions showed much imagination nevertheless.  The Tchaikovsky was tackled at a vital tempo and you whole-heartedly captured the spirit of this exciting ballet variation. There were imprecisions in the rapid chordal placements and greater clarity of articulation was required at times, but the playing had considerable sparkle in terms of dynamic shading and you committed enthusiastically to the closing accelerando to round of the piece with apt flamboyance.  The programme was presented in a confident and professional manner, with care taken to allow time in between the items. The technical element of the work showed a good level of agility and fluidity although there were quite a number of note diversions in the more challenging passagework, with a little more precision being needed at times. The contrasting styles and moods were conveyed with great verve and there was a compelling level of detail throughout in your artistic phrasing, although at times the flexibility of tempo and broad sweeping undulations in tone were over-exaggerated for the musical context. Nevertheless it was a vibrant and wholly-committed performance.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to your most imaginative interpretations today. Well done and good luck in all your future piano playing!"
JNReQRgw,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Sonata in D Kp 443 L418,D. Scarlatti,First movement from Sonata Op.49 No.2,Beethoven,79,"The Scarlatti was appropriately crisp and detached in presentation, which suited its style, and top lines were generally well projected. There was some shape emanating in the melodic parts, and ornamentation was stylish. There was unease in some of the coordination between the hands, and in the rhythmic momentum as more intricate patterns were navigated, which impeded the flow and sense of pulse. Notes were generally accurate, though, and there were moments of convincing light and shade.  In the Beethoven you accentuated the lyrical, bright nature of the music well, with clear melodic parts largely well supported in terms of tonal balance. Through the playing, a sense of the character and style came through, with contrasts in dynamics and tonal weight often suiting the music, particularly in the development section. Rhythmic balance and precision needed more consistency, with a tendency for quicker patterns such as triplets to lose their stability; early in the movement some tempo instability was felt, but overall there was good continuity with accurate pitches in place.  The performance overall was well paced and stylistically convincing, with clear shape and contrast making up for sometimes less assured technical control. Overall continuity was secure, with the small exception of the end of the Beethoven, and though tempo choices needed to be better supported by rhythmic delivery, there was lots of colour and boldness in your projection.  Thank you very much for sharing your performance! It was really enjoyable to hear your work."
JNdWqNBG,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Juin: Barcarolle,P.I. Tchaikovsky,"Mikrokosmos No. 153, Dance in Bulgarian Rhythm No. 6",Bela Bartok,76,"Tchaikovsky's Barcarolle saw expressive shaping of the melody from the outset, its tone singing suitably over a gentle accompaniment.  Chordal delivery was not consistently even, and although rubato was appropriate in its use, further movement forwards was sometimes needed.  However, the contrasts of character and tempo in the central section were clearly defined and despite some unease of pitch placement here, the drama of the music was found.    The percussive and energetic nature of the Bartok was evident, the tempo chosen ambitious and with tonal variaton in place.  Wider dynamic contrasts were made, and individual phrases saw appropriate shaping.  Delivery was prone to blemish and unevenness, particularly in the central section, with hand coordination and clarity of articulation sometimes compromised, and with not all notes securely centred.  However, the character of the music was retained throughout, rhythmic drive largely consistent.  Personal focus and  stylistic engagement were evident throughout this performance, the time taken between items well judged, and with poise maintained.  Despite the slightly less secure technical delivery of the Bartok and some blemish in the Tchaikovsky, you played with conviction, and this was an enjoyable performance, full of musical intention.  Congratulations on your performance, which saw clear stylistic understanding and differentiation.  I particularly enjoyed the energy of the Bartok."
JVolEnwg,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella,Agnieszka Lasko,Railroad Blues,David Blackwell,68,"Tarantella was taken at a lively pace and began well, with the LH crisply articulated. There were a couple of retakes and not quite all the quavers were evenly articulated, but notes and rhythms were otherwise in place. Greater attention to the opportunities for dynamic contrast would have brought the music to life more fully, but there was something of the dance character conveyed.  The tempo of Railroad Blues was apt and the LH was largely steadily played throughout, capturing the style, although there were a few moments when chords were retaken and the hands were not quite coordinated. There was room to give the music a greater variety of dynamic colouring but much of this was in place with the ending confidently presented.  Engagement and poise were maintained throughout and the pieces were well contrasted, with the transitiion between the two sensitively managed. Incorporation of more of the musical detail would have helped to characterise the pieces more effectively, but continuity was maintained, with all textures largely in place.  An enjoyable performance - well done!"
JZkKVWDy,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Romance, from ""Dances of the Dolls""",D. Shostakovich,Valse Etude,W. Gillock,87,"The Romance saw appropriate tonal projection in the melody, with some phrase shaping and dynamic variation in place. The compound lilt was defined, although there was scope for just a little more tonal shaping in the accompaniment, which sometimes became slightly too prominent in the texture, and further harmonic clarity would have enhanced this otherwise accurate and confident account.   The Valse Etude was played at a suitably fluent tempo, the use of rubato controlled and with a high degree of accuracy in place.  Fingerwork was largely even in the quaver movement, and some dynamic contrasts were apparent, although even greater attention to musical details and use of a wider dynamic range would have enhanced this. Nevertheless, despite occasional harmonic and textural blurring, this was an accurate and musically shaped rendition.   The commitment of your playing was evident throughout this performance, and the second piece started to see real engagement which was slightly missing from the Shostakovich.  Technical security and accuracy were highlights, and although use of a wider dynamic range would have enhanced musical characterisation at times, the contrasts of style were clearly defined and suitably paced.   Congratulations on your excellent performance.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the pleasure you conveyed as the Da Capo of the Gillock started."
JaMAvxWM,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Honey,R.N Dett,The Child that is Born on the Sabbath Day,R.R Bennett,69,"Notes were generally accurate in ”Honey” and there was some awareness of the character of the music, and its changing colours. Contrasts of tempo were sometimes overstated, though, with more thought needing to be given to the overall cohesion, the vivid pace changes tending to cause the piece to sound sectionalised. There were some balancing and voicing issues, but the playing was accurate in notes and rhythms, and utilised a wide dynamic range to provide stark mood changes.  The Bennett was positive from the outset and you caught something of the sparkling character of the opening section, contrasting it well with more lyrical dialogue later on. Emphases and articulation helped to direct the flow, though there was scope for more controlled gradation and less overt boldness at times. Technical blemishes became more telling in the second half, and rhythms in general needed to be tidier, but there was character in the playing nonetheless.  The overall performance was well paced and balanced, and evident thought had been given to the communication of these two different characters. Technical delivery did not always convince in the second piece and there was some less cohesively balanced flow in the Dett, but notes were broadly accurate and there were clear expressive statements.  Thank you for sharing your playing, and all good wishes for continued success and enjoyment in your music."
JgLaEEbR,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Sinfonia No. 15 in B Minor, BWV 801",J.S Bach,May (from the season),Tchaikovsky,85,"The Bach opened with confident stylistic energy and phrasing. Semiquaver passages were reliable and clearly defined, with thoughtful articulation in all parts throughout. At times the pulse became unsteady, slowing through unison semiquavers, with some untidiness between parts. Overall this flowed reliably, with some dynamic shaping and convincing musical direction.  The Tchaikovsky opening was musically shaped, with a clearly projected melodic line. Chords were carefully spread, with effective musical flexibility - though the pulse became unsettled where rhythmic figures were hurried, and long notes sometimes curtailed. The middle section was contrasted in mood, with mostly secure rhythmic control between hands. Sometimes the melody was rather overshadowed by accompanying textures, with parts not always neatly coordinated. Room for a wider dynamic range across the piece, though melodic lines had lyrical shape and direction; careful musical details and warmth in the tone here, with a poised ending.  This was an assured and poised performance. Different musical styles were communicated, with thoughtful musical details and shaping - though dynamic range was limited. Parts were not always balanced and neatly coordinated, but there was fluidity and commitment throughout.  I particularly enjoyed the stylistic clarity you achieved in the Bach"
JoPvwryb,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Always with me,Youmi Kiura and Wakako Kaku,The Muppet show theme,Jim Henson and Sam Pottle,72,"You established a calm sense of flow at the start of Always with Me, and the tonal projection was sensitively gentle. Some slight unevenness of rhythm and tone created bumpiness along the way, and there were some slips of note placement latterly, but the reflective mood of the piece was upheld throughout.  The Muppet Show Theme by contrast brought liveliness and vibrancy to the fore, and while the articulation sometimes needed to be crisper, there was a good sense of character established. A moment of uncertainty was present in the middle section, and pitch accuracy and rhythmical control required greater precision, but moments of buoyancy were effectively achieved.  Your playing showed focus and commitment, and you brought a keen sense of contrast to the two works, engaging well with the styles and moods. There was nonetheless room for more shapely phrasing and vibrant articulation, and there were slips present, but much of the performance conveyed a degree of clarity in the detail.  Well done for achieving such varied and characterful playing!"
JooEbxWe,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Forget Me Not Waltz,Stephen Duro,Daydream,Kristina Arakelyan,83,"The Forget Me Not Waltz began with smooth phrases and textures were well balanced. There was a suitable lilt present in part, and the tone was clean and clear throughout. Whilst there was scope for the lyrical components of the piece to be more expressive, and a wider range of dynamic and tonal colours explored, phrases did move with a sense of direction and the notes were secure in relation to pitch.  The rhythmic components of the second piece were well managed, with a positive sense of flow and lines given space to breathe in relation to the style. There was scope for greater interplay between the hands, but the performance was technically secure and an appropriate mood was created.  A strong sense of poise and control was conveyed throughout the performance, and there was organised pacing between the individual items. The different musical identities of the pieces came across in part, with an appropriate atmosphere created, just leaving room for more vivid and expressive portrayal overall. The technical demands of the programme were robust and positively met throughout.  This was a very assured and well controlled performance - well done."
JrWqOoYx,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Spinning Song,A.Ellmenreich,A Town With An Ocean View(Kiki’s Delivery Service),Joe Hisaishi,79,"’Spinning Song’ was both well paced and fluently managed, a grasp of the musical idea clearly conveyed. Right hand material generally needed more projection, with scope for more consistency in the touch, this would have enhanced the articulation generally. It could also have afforded more defined shaping and phrasing overall, but the notes were reliably managed.  A poised approach was an apt feature in the Hisaishi which set up the musical mood well. The balance between the hands and control of the legato articulation could have been further refined, with scope to differentiate the non-staccato quavers in the left hand accompaniment. Still it was colourful playing and entirely fluent, the character clearly captured.  This was a committed performance which showed a firm grasp of the different musical moods, with a more personal sense of connection with the music achieved in the second piece. More outward projection and a little more poise between items would have enhanced the feeling of performance awareness and control, but the technical elements of the playing were well managed.  Well done! A fluent performance with an admirable sense of sincerity sustained in your approach. I hope that taking part, and this very good result, gives you a well earned sense of confidence as you progress on your musical journey."
JwJDLvWL,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella Twist,Victoria Proudler,Always with Me,"Youmi Kimura, Wakako Kaku",65,"Tarantella Twist began at a suitable pace and was accurately played at the outset. The tempo was not always successfully maintained as the piece went on, though, with several slightly cautious moments and occasional melodic errors. There was room to make much more of the rise and fall in the shape of the phrases, but something of the dance style was captured in the more fluent sections.  Always with Me was brisk in tempo and secure in notes and rhythms but for a couple of rhythmically imprecise moments. A greater exploration of shape and colour in the phrasing would have brought the music to life more fully, but momentum was maintained and the ending boldly managed.  Engagement and poise were maintained throughout this performance of two effectively contrasted pieces. Delivery was more successfully controlled in the second half of the programme than the first, and the two styles could have been more strongly contrasted through the incorporation of more of the musical detail, but tempi were well chosen.  Congratulations on a good performance."
Jzzkpboj,13-15,Up to Grade 5,"Study in D minor, no.40 from Studies for the piano, op.65",Albert Loeschhorn,Ground Background Music (Super Mario Bros),Koji Kondo,78,"The Loeschhorn began with confident momentum and a projected melody. Melodic semiquavers had reliable clarity, but were sometimes slightly unrhythmic, particularly later on. Fleeting untidiness between hands, and a few blemishes in chords - which needed more lightness at times. There was dynamic variety, but scope for more shaping through phrases; overall this was fluent and assured.    The Kondo was characterful, with bright energy and carefully placed chords. Rhythmic assurance at first, but there were unsteady moments where the pulse slightly hurried. Small blemishes were not disruptive, with crisp repeated note figures; scope for wider dynamic variety, but there was stylistic energy here.    This was a confident performance, with mainly reliable pulse and technical control - though pacing between pieces was rather rushed. Fleeting blemishes and unsteady rhythms were unsettling, but not disruptive - overall there was assured continuity.    I particularly enjoyed the way you engaged with the style of the second piece, and communicated the humorous mood."
KElXlakb,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Sad Ghost by,Nancy Litten,The Song of Twilight –,Yoshinao Nakada,82,"Sad Ghost was well judged in tempo, with a clear feeling of rhythmic lilt and sincerity in the phrasing. There was room for even more dynamic differentiation, especially in the quietest passages, but you captured the mysterious character throughout.   Song of Twilight was carefully sustained and pedalling was efficient, though not always wholly discreet. Semiquavers were occasionally uneven and there was room for further consideration of balance, allowing the melody a little more textural freedom. However, this was well shaped and confident playing.  You played with obvious enjoyment, and space between pieces was carefully judged. There was scope for even more refined musical detail and for further consideration of balance, especially in the second piece, but the contrasting styles were firmly delivered.  This was confident and often detailed playing, with obvious stylistic ideas. Well done."
KJwZOJjZ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata in D Major, K. 443, L. 418",Domenico Scarlatti,Danny Boy,"Trad. Irish, arr. Nikki Iles",77,"Scarlatti’s Sonata saw tonal brightness and appropriate variation of articulation, helping to shape the line. Occasional blemishes of evenness and clarity in repeated notes were apparent, and pulse stability was briefly compromised at the start of the second half, with a few slips of pitch placement apparent as the half progressed. However, musical intention remained clear throughout, with dynamic contrasts clearly defined and with ornaments very well executed.  ’Danny Boy’ was played with clear melodic projection and a sense of flexibility, both in terms of tempo and tone. Rhythmic distinction was sometimes compromised, however, longer notes not always held for their full value, and use of a wider tonal range would have enhanced the harmonic outline and changes of tonality, with occasional moments of harmonic blurring occurring. Nonetheless, the musical style was in place, and much was accurately played.  Musical involvement and engagement were evident throughout your performance, and the contrasts of style were securely outlined. Despite the occasional technical blemish, much of the delivery was accurate, with textural balancing largely well managed and with musical intention clear throughout.  Congratulations on this assured and very good performance. I particularly enjoyed the expressive melodic shaping in your second piece."
KMElDLNL,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Round and Round,Jung Jae-il,In the Dead of Night,Edmund Jolliffe,78,"The first piece was bold in tone, with the hands well coordinated and the textures well balanced. Phrases had a strong and reliable pulse and generally moved with a sense of direction, though there was room to explore more contoured shaping and a wider range of tonal colours and dynamic invovlement. The performance itself was clean, with the notes accurate in relation to pitch throughout.   In the Dead of Night was mysterious in part, and there was some organised dynamic involvement, though scope for the lyrical and expressive components of the character to be more forthcoming and persuasive, and for the tone to develop the sensitive and meaningful colours more vividly. The ending was well managed though, and the parts were confidently controlled in relation to the rhythms.   The textures were well balanced throughout, with parts clean and confidently projected. The overall sense of performance would have been enhanced by longer framing of the pieces with silence and stillness, allowing the openings and endings more space to breathe. The different musical identities of the pieces came across in part, with some changes of tone and dynamic, but leaving room to be more vivid, capturing the individual characteristics more effectively. The technical demands of the programme were met with positivity.   Thank you for playing - I really appreciated the technical control that you demonstrated and how secure your pieces were in relation to the notes."
KRBZbvBZ,7-9,Up to Grade 5,"Sonatina Op55, No1 (vivace) 2nd movement",Friedrich Kuhlau,Summer,Joe Hisaishi,82,"You brought vibrancy to the opening passages of the Kuhlau Sonatina movement, which was well-defined in terms of articulation and rhythmic lift. Often you brought commendable dexterity and sparkling detail to the figures, though an inclination to hurry through the phrases sometimes affected the otherwise firm rhythmic grounding, and there was scope for more flexibility in shaping the lines. Otherwise this was confident playing.  Summer by Hisaishi opened with solid left-hand control, setting up a driving sense of impetus. As the piece unfolded there were moments when the rhythms required a little more evenness of control, but the dynamic contrasts were effectively achieved, and there was suitable grandeur built up in the middle. A small slip hindered the flow at one stage, and more poise was generally needed in the rhythmic patterns, but a vivid feeling of character was ever-present.  Well-presented, and with a real sense of performance awareness being communicated, you brought vitality and spirit to your playing. Although the flow was slightly undermined by a feeling of rushing at times, the rhythmic detail was largely clear, and the interpretations were sensitively attuned to the styles of the works, with just room for more variety of contour overall.  Congratulations on these engaging performances!"
KWwokJNK,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Spiritoso, 1st movement from sonatina in C, op36 no3",Muzio Clementi,Love Theme,Catherine Rollin,79,"The Clementi had a bright attack and good sense of rhythmic purpose, with articulation ideas assisting the classical style. Not all of the semiquavers were evenly presented, with hands also calling for extra clarity of coordination. Dynamic involvement was well gauged, giving dramatic moments positive impact.  Love Song was played with sincerity and expressive charm. Pedal gave valuable warmth of tone, with a flexible approach often winning through. Balance did not always favour the top line, and a more consistent cantabile effect could have been of help in regard to phrasing, though it flowed along with good accuracy and grasp of the modern romantic style.  The two pieces contrasted well, demonstrating a clear awareness of the different styles and characters. In delivery, there was a degree of unevenness and inconsistency, which impeded the overall level of sparkle and clarity heard in the playing, and a few extra seconds of repose between items could have been useful. The best playing captured musical detail with imagination and conviction.  Many congratulations on a very good all-round performance, and best wishes for the future!"
KZOdLGna,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Musical Sketch in B flat,Felix Mendelssohn,Lowside Blues,Joanna MacGregor,83,"Musical Sketch flowed well at a sensibly gauged speed, capturing the romantic style ably. Pedal added welcome warmth and colour, with a well balanced texture and clear sense of musical purpose achieved. A still brighter, more colourful tone for the melody could have added to its intensity and poise, though all was accurate and very well under control, with moments of flexibility confidently included.  Lowside Blues had a firmly established pulse and examples of good finger control. It called for extra grittiness in tone and attack, to more fully bring out the laidback, bluesy style, and there was unevenness to the final ascending flourish, but the main musical landmarks in the piece were thoughtfully brought out.  In both pieces there was accuracy and consistency of effect, with style identities brought out and, especially during the Mendelssohn, a clear sense of instinctive engagement. While room remained for additional pizzazz and spontaneity in the second item, there was a well gauged pause between the two pieces and much overall musicality on display.  Many congratulations on this excellent performance!"
KZVbEEnb,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Sunsets in Savannah,Randall Hartsell,Arabesque,Johann Friedrich Burgmüller,73,"The reflective character of Sunsets in Savannah was quickly felt, and the tempo was well judged. There was some feeling of expressive shape in the phrasing, though pedalling lacked efficiency between bars, and there was room for even more dynamic shading. However, a sense of flexibility was more frequently detected in the second half.  The playful character of the Arabesque was conveyed and details of articulation were closely observed. Keeping all semiquavers under even control was a challenge, but the lively tempo was rigorously kept much of the time, and hands worked carefully together.  This was a varied programme, with some feeling of reflective space between pieces. Keeping all faster notes under even control was not quite managed, and there was room for even more musical detail, but hands were well synchronised. A clear feeling of enjoyment was conveyed.  Well done. I especially enjoyed the excitement of the Arabesque."
KaAbrRzE,7-9,Up to Grade 5,The Joker and The Queen,"Ed Sheeran, Samuel Roman, Johnny McDaid, Taylor Swift and Fred Gibson",Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammond,83,"There was a warmth in the opening tone of The Joker and the Queen, and the hands were mostly well balanced. More expressive shaping of the melodic line would have helped to really capture the musical mood but the notes were secure and the ending well managed .  The staccato detail was crisp throughout Spooky Wood Hollow and the hands were well balanced with a clear grasp of the rhythmic swing style in place. Vivid dynamic detail fully supported the character, with a good sense of drive and energy in the performance.  There was a strong sense of engagement with the well contrasted musical characters of your chosen pieces, and this was communicative playing, particularly in the realisation of the musical detail of your second piece.  An assured performance - well done on this excellent result."
KrLQegkq,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Invention No.14 in B flat, BWV 785",J.S. Bach,Last Song (from The Secret Piano),Alexis Ffrench,77,"The Bach was neatly articulated at a lively tempo. There was a hint of unevenness in the demisemiquaver work and the occasional incorrect accidental or miscounted rhythm appeared but the flow was effectively maintained within a stable underlying pulse. There was welcome thought and detail in your shaping of phrases, albeit with the swells in tone being a little too sudden and overstated for the musical context at times. Nevertheless you provided a good level of colour and the style was conveyed with appropriate charm.  In ’Last Song’ there was much intensity of expression and the sentimental quality of the writing was engagingly depicted. The rubato was at times a little too over-pronounced, particularly when used early in the piece, whilst there were several small note slips and a few smudges of texture within the pedalling. However the graceful phrasing and well highlighted melodic lines helped to provide a thoughtful and sincere interpretation.  You presented the programme in an unhurried and professional manner, taking appropriate time between the items. From a technical perspective there was a good sense of overall fluidity in the playing although various note misjudgements occurred en route. Pedalling added to the tonal warmth and despite some blurring of harmonies the melodic lines were mostly well defined. The contrasting styles and moods were sensitively conveyed, with a natural enjoyment of the contouring of phrases, if with some excess in terms of rubato on occasions. The performance as a whole was nonetheless committed and musically connected.  Some enjoyable and expressive playing here - well done!  ."
KxbqDZWq,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Allegro con spririto(1st movt from Sonatina in C Op.55 No.3,Kuhlau,Arabesque Sentimentale,Gillock,86,"Kuhlau's 'Sonatina' was colourful and elegant, the outer sections particularly clear in their phrasing. Semiquaver passages could have afforded even more precision, with some parts of the middle section less tightly rhythmic, the pulse tending not to be quite as firm near the semiquaver rests in the left hand. Otherwise this was a balanced and charming account.   Warmth of tone was a strong feature through the Gillock, with the legato also well managed. A few notes were less clearly voiced early on, slightly jogging the rhythmic effect in the first few phrases. Shaping and projection of the melodic line generally needed further definition, particularly at louder points, but it was fluent playing that still captured the character of the work well.   Poised playing, with a clear understanding of the different musical idioms communicated. Control of rhythm and tone could have been more consistent and brought even more clarity, with opportunity for more defined phrasing and shaping also remaining. There was a clear sense of invovlmnet with the performance though, and the programme came to a suitably poignant conclusion.   Excellent playing! There was a real sense of style in both pieces, and you made good use of the range of colour your instrument offered you. I sincerely hope you continue to share your musical skill and insight with others in future performances!"
KzAkADyO,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Village in May,Joe Hisaishi,Foggy Blues,Naoko Ikeda,89,"A bright, cheery sense of the character of The Village in May was present from the outset, and you brought buoyancy and control to the rhythms. Full note accuracy was guaranteed, and while more flexibility in shaping the phrases was possible, you upheld the tempo and pace with consistency and drive.  Foggy Blues was appropriately broody in its mood, and a certain amount of lyricism in the projection of the melody was present, even if there was scope at times for more nuance and colour in the right-hand, as well as stylistic ebb and flow in the phrases. Nonetheless you built up to the climax to good effect and the flow was always maintained with reliable regularity.  These were both sensitive performances, and the overall feeling of contrast between the works was clear, just needing a little more variety in the phrasing to draw out yet more expressiveness from the music. Your playing was appropriately focused and committed though, producing playing of quality and control.  Congratulations on this excellent presentation!"
LBXxZdQR,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Jie Guo Yi Xia,Zhou Yi Li,Ninette's Musette,George Nevada,75,"Excuse Me had a clear rhythmic underpinning to it, with securely coordinated hands and tidy syncopated details. There was scope to introduce further dynamic variety and shape to the phrases, for added interest, as well as for a more subdued left hand accompaniment, though this was accurate and consistent playing.  Ninette’s Musette achieved a good level of fluidity and control, with the music’s sentimental character portrayed at a wise choice of speed. There were further opportunities for expressive detail and phrase shaping still to explore, and for the accompaniment to be more subtly controlled against the sweet melody, though this was accurately and rhythmically presented.  A very good level of accuracy and momentum came through in the playing, and rhythmic aspects were often securely coordinated between the hands. While there was scope for additional subtleties of balance, shape and dynamic contrasts in each of the pieces, the playing was projected and musically equipped. The transition between items could have benefited from a few seconds of stillness, though the approach was confident and outgoing.  Many congratulations, and best wishes for the future!"
LOWaxdpk,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Presto (3rd movement from Sonata No.6 in C minor),G.B.Prescetti,Ticklin' Toes,Florence B.Price,75,"The Pescetti was confidently delivered with fluid lines and bold dynamic contrasts, although losing poise and pulse stability in the final stages. There was room for more elegance in some of the phrase endings and the left-hand could have been more lightly articulated at cadential points. A neat flow was always in place though, carrying the music forwards.  A nearly always controlled lively tempo and bright articulation gave the Price much energy and this was played with a real sense of the character. A slight sense of push left some corners unclear and softer dynamics could have been further developed. However there was an engaging flair to the delivery.  Whilst there could have been more variety in the dynamic levels throughout, there was a strong communicative spirit and many exciting moments.  Well done, some very good playing which I enjoyed."
LRVgLOwp,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Mazurka in A Minor,Fryderyk Chopin,"Snow, Moon and Flowers from Night Pieces",Peter Sculthorpe,79,"The Chopin was played with appropriate softness of tone and the running embellishments were shaped with apt elegance. The use of pedal enriched the tone quality although there was a tendency towards blurred harmonies where further precision was needed in the timing of pedal changes. The climaxes were effectively gauged and the melodic line was mostly well highlighted, if with room for further tonal nuancing in the A major passage. The structure of the piece was, however, well understood and carefully marked in your adjustments of tempo, whilst some welcome touches of rubato enhanced the more tender moments.  ’Sun, Moon and Flowers’ was conveyed with a thoughtful sense of atmosphere and the accented notes were carefully pinpointed. The richer timbres were warmly portrayed and a broad spectrum of colours was deployed, if with room for further spaciousness of phrasing to allow the ethereal effects to settle at times. The cascading figures were evenly and confidently executed in what was an imaginative interpretation.  You presented the performance in a calm manner, with appropriate time being taken in between the items. From a technical perspective there was mostly good rhythmical control and note accuracy in evidence, though with clearer textures being required where the pedalling was less precise. The contrasting styles were well realised, however, with some thoughtful use of gentle tone colours in particular and sensitivity to the shaping of phrases. The performance as a whole was stylistically aware and showed a clear sense of musical involvement.  Some committed and expressive playing developing. Well done!"
LXNdpXlO,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Étude in C Major, Op. 10, No. 1",Frédéric Chopin,Scherzo Valse from Pieces Pittoresques No. 10,Emmanuel Chabrier,95,"There was much positive and focused playing in the Chopin. The right-hand arpeggiated detail was almost always secure, with only brief fluctuations in evenness or precision not affecting the overall momentum. Tempo was well judged and there was bold, well projected fullness of sound. There was scope to find a little more light and shade, particularly in finding moments of respite within the complex sound world. Nevertheless, this was a very convincing account, with effective melodic and harmonic design in place.  The buoyant, rhythmical energy of the Chabrier was compellingly conveyed and there was an commendable balance between rhythmic excitement and tonal colour. Melodic lines were well projected and there were moments of lyrical insight to counter the sparkling passagework. Fleeting stumbles were not disruptive to the momentum, though in the central 3/8 section there was room for slightly wider dynamic breadth and greater lightness and control, to ensure important lines were always fully clear. This part still afforded effective contrast of character, though, and the return to the opening material in the coda was carried off with compelling flair.  This was very engaging and bold playing, lacking just a little lightness at times, but with very assured, nuanced and nimble passagework evident in both pieces. There was a convincing balance between stylistic and expressive design and secure technical delivery, which made for a compelling performance.  Well done indeed! This was impressive playing, and I enjoyed hearing your very authentic and individual approach to these two demanding pieces."
LaQMNNwl,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Milonga del angel,Astor piazzolla,il porco Rosso from porco rosso,Joe hisaishi,80,"The first piece had a clear sense of flow and a gentle warmth was created in the tone. The melodic line was effectively projected over the more flowing a compliment and phrases were given gentle, yet expressive shaping. The more energetic middle section provided a clear contrast, but even more energy could have been found here. The chordal accompaniment was mostly managed and the hands were balanced and coordinated. The lyrical style was well realised and the playing had some sense of outward presentation.   Il Porco Rosso also had a sense of flow and serenity, and the phrases were given expressive shaping and some tonal variation. Rhythmic outlines were mostly poised, yet fluid and the account held a sense of cohesion. The legato was not always maintained in the more chordal passages, but the note placing was reliable and the style was well realised and communicated.  Rather more contrast between the pieces would have been welcome to demonstrate a more rounded technical approach. However, the detailing and engagement with the two styles was suitably nuanced and both pieces showed musical involvement and conviction. The technical delivery was reliable and the sense of presentation was outward and communicative, with some well explored tonal varation and articulation. An excellent and engaging performance. Well done!"
LaqdOGbn,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Invention No 14 in Bb Major,J.S. Bach,Waltz in A Minor,Frederic Chopin,74,"The Bach unfolded a gently flowing pace with some clear part-shaping throughout. There was room for stronger phrasing and harmonic direction here and some unnecessary accents disrupted the lines as it progressed. However there was an overall arc to the account which worked well.   Expressive lines and a sensitively balanced accompaniment characterised the Chopin. A little more contrast could have been found to vary the repeating motif with particular differentiation for the major part. Although some uncertain moments affected the flow towards the end, this was generally assured and fluid playing.   A neatly contrasted programme, the second piece was particularly convincing. Presentation was calm and committed throughout.   Well done on achieving many stylish moments in this enjoyable performance."
LdloqzRj,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata k457 in c minor, 1st movement",Mozart,Etude op72 no2,Moszkowski,93,"The Mozart was tackled with appropriate drama and energy. There was refinement in the tonal colouring and the melodic lines projected with clarity. Occassional blurs of harmony occurred within the pedalling but a broad range of dynamic colours was explored. In the LH triplet figures there was a slight element of unevenness but the vigour of the writing was convincingly caught, with incisive articulations being combined with a stylish spaciousness of phrasing.  The Etude was vividly characterised, with a suitably flamboyant tempo being adopted. There was a need for further textural clarity at times, with not all of the running passagework being clear in articulation and a few brief note blemishes appearing, but the momentum was determinedly sustained and there was much fire and vivacity in terms of dynamic sparkle and rhythmical impetus.  The performance itself was presented in a calm and professional manner, with unhurried pacing between items. You showed an assured level of technical and interpretive adaptability across the two contrasting styles, with a broad range of tone colours conveying a sense of full-blooded musical engagement.  Congratulations on this highly persuasive performance and good luck with all your future piano playing!"
Leojqxqb,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Giga in D: from Lessons for the Harpsichord, Op.2",Elisabetta de Gambarini,Vals poetico: No.6 from Valses poeticos,Enrique Granados,90,"The Giga was played with clear definition of the compound metre, and tonal lightness supported the style. The repeats of each half saw even more dynamic variation and tonal shaping, and although greater dynamic contrast between phrases and variation of articulation would have given even more character to the account, and with momentary extension of one beat latterly due to ornament execution, this was accurately played.  The Valse saw appropriate use of rubato, and throughout, the melody projected above warm and even chords. Shaping of the line helped to enhance the expressive character, despite occasional lapses of evenness in the quietest moments, and this was an accurate and musically considered rendition.  You played with poise and conviction throughout this performance, the contrasting styles tonally defined and with appropriate time allowed between the two items. Even greater projection of stylistic engagement and stillness at the end would have added to the sense of performance, particularly in the Granados, although musical integrity was maintained in the performance itself, with focus consistent.  Congratulations on this impressive performance, your delivery showing accuracy and assurance, and I wish you every success in your musical ventures."
LkeQJOkK,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata in A Major, W.55/4",Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach,Etude Opus 10 No. 6,Frederic Chopin,82,"The CPE Bach began at an assured tempo, with bold direction. Chords were bright and neatly placed, with fluid and mainly reliable semiquaver passages - though these were often rather rushed and lacked clarity. Some careful articulation and stylistic phrasing here, with vibrant energy throughout; there were moments of untidiness between hands, with melodic detail at ends of phrases often unclear - and increasingly hurried pulse as it progressed. Overall this had convincing musical focus and some dynamic variety, with bold transitions between sections.  The Chopin had musical conviction and a projected legato melody. Accompanying figures were mainly reliable and fluid, with some convincing musical flexibility; parts needed more careful balancing throughout, with the melody often rather overpowered, and textures and harmonic progressions sometimes becoming unclear. A few small blemishes were not intrusive; the expressive climax in the middle was effective, with some dynamic shaping within phrases - though much quieter playing was needed at times. Overall this flowed reliably, with sincere lyrical direction.  This was an assured performance, with different styles effectively communicated - though pacing between pieces was rather rushed. Mostly secure technical control throughout, apart from blemishes and hurried, untidy moments in the first piece; scope for quieter, gentler playng at times, but this was musically convincing overall.  I particularly enjoyed the vibrant energy you communicated in the CPE Bach."
LmzMelOw,13-15,Up to Grade 5,La tarentelle,J. F. F. Burgmüller,In the Hall of the Mountain King,Edvard Grieg,79,"Graded dynamics were explored, and there was bounce in the touch. Untidy co-ordination was audible in places, however, with bolder use of contrast possible. Even though further detail was necessary, the dance element remained alive, with the essential ’skip’ realised for this tarantella.  Staccato notes were clean in attack, with off-beat chords precise in the Grieg. It was possible to voice the chords further, despite this, and there was greater drama and pacing awaiting capture. At times, the playing was a little one-coloured, but forward flow remained assured, with the tone clear.  Lively tempo choices characerised these interpretations, and varied articulation was commanded. Greater contrast in mood was necessary between the two pieces, nonetheless, with bolder phrase shapes and a more expressive singing line required at times. Although even deeper engagement in the music was desirable, vitality and buoyancy were captured, with variation in dynamics achieved.  A lively sense of rhythm was communicated in your playing, and the music was always able to dance. Well done on a most enjoyable performance!"
LnwbNOAW,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Presto - Second movement from Sonata No. 6 in C,J.W. Hassler,A Nightingale Sang in Berkely Square,Manning Sherwin & Eric Maschwitz,85,"A bright tempo was adopted at the start of the Presto, and the account had a sense of flow and direction. The semiquavers were mostly even and controlled, but rather more care could have been taken with tapering at the end of phrases. The hands were mostly well coordinated and balanced, though there was a little heaviness in the left hand at times, and the delivery was reliable. Rhythmic patterns were precise and defined and fingerwork showed agility. A wider dynamic range could have been explored but this was a lively and energetic account, with a clear sense of the style.  Some sweet tonal effects were created at the start of the lyrical Nightingale in Berkeley Square, and the tempo was suitably fluid and relaxed. Chords were not always placed together and the melodic line could have had even more projection through the accompaniment. The rubato could have been even more stretched and a little more shaping and expression found. The notes were largely reliable and the account was atmospheric and communicative.  The chosen pieces were suitably contrasted and the varied stylistic detailing and tonal qualities were effectively nuanced, showing stylistic awareness. A greater sense of outward presentation and conviction could have been found but the playing was secure and accomplished, and held a sense of musical involvement. An engaging performance, well done!"
LpBbrgjJ,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Minuet in C,Alexander Reinagle,The Quiet Wood,Michael Head,77,"Minuet in C was clean and balanced in tone, with hands moving confidently together. There were some organised contrasts of dynamic and the articulation was effective, though room for the shaping to be even more vibrant and communicative. Phrases moved with a sense of direction, though there was scope for tighter rhythmic control within the left hand in places. Notes were secure in relation to pitch.  The second piece began with a soft and sincere sound, which was largely even and controlled. Some notes were sustained beyond their note length which did produce some clashes of sound, but phrases were smooth and had a sense of momentum. There was scope for the lyrical and expressive components of the character to be more forthcoming, but an appropriate mood was emerging overall.  This was well controlled and lines were clean throughout, with a sense of involvement present. The pacing between the individual items left room for more space to breathe, but the musical identites of the pieces came across in part. Although there was room for more colourful portrayal and technical control in parts, the challenges of the programme were generally well met.  I particularly enjoyed the rhythmic character created in the first piece! Thank you for playing."
MLblkNYp,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Melody in F,Louis Kohler,Cyberspace Detective,Amit Anand,83,"A decisive feeling of direction was immediately established in your playing of Melody in F, and your playing brought warm tonal projection to the fore, even if there was room for more musical shape in both melody and accompaniment. There were moments of slight unevenness along the way, but for the most part this was a reliable rhythmical account.  Cyberspace Detective brought incisiveness and intensity to the rhythmic figures, and there was a keen sense of character conveyed. Occasionally the patterns became slightly unsteady, but there was always a driving sense of impetus, bringing energy and conviction to your playing.  This was a performance which showed involvement and insight, with an especially good feeling for the mood of the second piece. More variety and flexibility was possible overall, as well as for firmer control of the rhythms, but security in other aspects of the delivery was commendably reliable.  Congratulations on achieving such assurance and character in your performance!"
MNmXrOoa,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Menuet and Trio,Joseph Haydn,Sunset in Savannah,Randall Hartsell,80,"The Haydn began with a confident, rhythmic Menuet; parts were neatly coordinated, though more stylistic lightness would have been welcome. The pulse was consistent, but with scope for rather more forward direction - though phrases were thoughtfully shaped. The Trio was contrasted, with fluid legato and careful dynamic shaping - though more quiet playing was needed. There was slight hesitancy between phrases, but overall this was secure and fluent.  ’Sunset in Savannah’ flowed musically, with sustained direction through phrases. The tone was assured, with accompanying chords neatly placed, though sometimes slightly overshadowing the melody - particularly in the middle. Secure rhythmic flow throughout, with effective musical flexibility; room for quieter dynamics to suit the mood, but this was sensitive and lyrical.  This was a fluent, confident presentation; different styles were communicated with some dynamic shaping - though often quieter, lighter playing would have been welcome. Technical details were secure, but parts sometimes needed more careful balancing; overall this was a musically committed performance.  I particularly enjoyed your sensitively shaped melody in ’Sunset in Savannah’."
MPYkrQrk,7-9,Grade 5 and above,Prelude No 6 in D minor BMV875,J S Bach,Sonata in C major K545 1st Movement Allegro,Mozart,78,"Bach’s Prelude was played at a suitably fluent tempo, with fingerwork in the semiquavers even and well articulated. Occasional blemishes of hand coordination occurred, with a tendency to rush in some of the episodes. However, although even greater control of tonal shaping was possible, particularly towards the end, the overall contrapuntal texture was defined, and accuracy was consistent.  The Mozart Sonata movement saw appropriate projection of the melody, with tone bright. Dynamic contrasts helped to define the structure, and some phrase shaping was evident, with room for just a little more control at times. The development section started to rush marginally, and evenness and accuracy were sometimes compromised, more so in the left hand, but overall, this was a confident and accurate account.   Overall technical assurance was evident in this performance, and you played with a real sense of commitment. Further stylistic engagement was possible, the hair covering your face preventing assessment of communication and involvement, although clear focus was retained, and as a whole, the performance flowed well with some stylistic contrast in place.  Congratulations on this committed performance, and I wish you every success in your future music making."
MQQnaVYb,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella Twist,Victoria Proudler,Always with Me: from Spirited Away,Youmi Kimura & Wakako Kaku,68,"You projected the tone firmly in Tarantella Twist, and there was a determined sense of flow established at the start. The choice of tempo was on the cautious side, limiting the sense of the lively character of the tarantella, and there were some tempo fluctuations as the piece unfolded, with some stumbles affecting the regularity of flow, though note accuracy was largely secure.  Always With Me was played sensitively and there was apt gentleness in the tonal projection. The lines were a little angular, needing more fluidity as well as expressive shape, and the flow was sometimes hindered by errors along the way, but you mostly brought clarity and smoothness to the phrases.  A good feeling of commitment pervaded this performance, and you contrasted the two works effectively. More expressive input was possible, and the lack of direction and shape of the phrases limited the sense of variety overall, but you always maintained a good feeling of focus throughout.  Well done - your playing showed purpose and firm musical foundations!"
MVjWBXrg,7-9,Up to Grade 5,études de mécanisme op. 849: nos. 5,Czerny,Invention 13 in a minor bwv 784,Bach,83,"The first piece began with a clean, bright tone and the hands were well coordinated. Phrases always moved with a sense of direction and some shaping, though some passages rushed forward, leaving room for a more robust pulse. There was scope for the dotted rhythms of the melody to be even tighter in places, but on the whole, the performance was energised and positive, with the notes accurate in relation to pitch.   The Bach was fluent, with the lines stylistically shaped. The contrasts of artiulcation were effective and consistently applied, with the textures well balanced too. There was room for the lines to be even more vibrant and colourful, but the performance itself was confident and spirited.   A sense of involvement was conveyed as lines were well projected, and textures balanced. The different moods of each piece were created, and there were some stylistic nuances, but room for the interpretations to be even more purposeful and bold in their communication. There was scope for even tighter coordination and rhythmic control, but this was generally short-lived, with the technical demands of the programme largely well met.   I particularly enjoyed the sense of urgency, fluency and purpose within your performances. Well done."
MdWZVjnl,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Mister Trumpet Man,William Gillock,Summer,Joe Hisaishi,81,"Mister Trumpet Man benefited from a crisp, decisive attack, with the swinging style well established. The tempo was well chosen, though a more regular underlying pulse was needed, to fully anchor the performance, and scope remained for a wider range of tonal and dynamic effects. Accurate in notes, and often showing the jazzy style in a good light.  Summer had a forthright tempo and good coordination between the hands, bringing the infectious spirit of the piece to life confidently. Pedal added valuably to the more vigorous, accented areas, and a dainty left hand accompaniment was sustained where needed. Despite a call for an even more settled pulse initially, and for extra subtleties of touch control as it went along, this was an ably presented account.   There was a clear sense of involvement and conviction, with a good contrast in styles achieved across the two pieces. A few extra seconds of repose between items could have further enhanced the appearance, and further subtleties of touch and dynamics were achievable, though there was an excellent level of musicality to commend overall, the second piece sounding especially convincing.   Congratulations on your playing, and very best wishes for a musical future!"
MeNwkyGe,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Song of Twilight (from Piano Pieces for Children),Nakada,T-Rex Hungry (from A Day in the Life of a T-Rex),Chua,83,"Song of Twilight was well judged in tempo and this was a carefully sustained performance with some consistent shaping. The overall dynamic level was quite strong, with little obvious variety, and this did not fully capture the reflective mood. Hands, though, were confidently syncronised.   T-Rex Hungry was full of determination and danger from the start, with plenty of bold articulation. Most quavers were well controlled, though there was slight loss of momentum in the closing bars and joining phrases was not always seamless. However, this was energised and characterful playing.  This performance showed an understanding of pacing, with time between pieces for reflection and readjustment. You played with obvious determination and energy, especially in the second piece, and musical ideas were often stylish. There was scope for even more of the refined detail to add further polish, but your enjoyment was openly shared.  Well done. This was determined and colourful playing. I especially enjoyed your commitment to the charatcer of T-Rex Hungry."
MlRQbALE,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata in G Major, K.146",Domenico Scarlatti,"Trois Etudes de Concert, No.3 in D-Flat Major",Franz Liszt,96,"The fingerwork was light and defined and the start and gave a suitable brightness to the account. The ornaments were neatly incorporated into the musical line and the account had a sense of flow. The more legato passages provided a clear contrast and the phrases had touches of subtle shaping. The technical delivery was secure and this was a bright and characterful interpretation.  The hands were balanced in favour of the melodic line at the start and there was continued, and impressive, coordination between the hands. The tempo was suitably fluid and the rubato styling was sensitive and showed expressive and musical awareness. The long lucious phrases had contouring and tonal and dynamic variation.The quicker passsages were mostly even and the fingerwork had a crystalline quality in places. More chordal sections had depth and the ending was poised and restrained.  The programme was suitably contrasted and the sense of presentation was consistently outward and communicative, with an air of authority and musical assurance. The technical delivery was almost flawless and the expressive detailing was suitably nuanced in this very engaging and outstanding performance. Bravo!"
NBAznpqY,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Entertainer,Scott Joplin,Ecossaise in G,Ludwig van Beethoven,89,"The Entertainer was taken at a lively pace and the detached LH gave the music buoyancy from the outset. Dynamic contrasts were colourful and the music had a sense of shape throughout. But for one melodic smudge and room for further rhythmic energy all was securely in place in this characterful account.  There was a sense of energy and spirit in Ecossaise in G, with the crisp articulation capturing the style. Dynamic contrasts were colourful throughout and the playing was rhythmic with a consistent sense of momemtum maintained. There was just room for a slightly warmer tone in some of the louder moments, but this was engaging and characterful playing.  This was a well communicated performance, full of colour and contrast throughout. Poise was maintained and the transition between the two contrasting pieces was well judged. The styles were aptly differentiated through the incorporation of a wealth of musical detail.  An excellent performance - well done!"
NDawkgAl,7-9,Up to Grade 5,The Singing Swan,Alexis Ffrench,Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammond,75,"Delicate colours were explored in ’The Singing Swan’, and the pulse possessed clarity. It was possible for the melody to sing with further shape and expression, however, and some vitality and focus waned towards the end when the tempo slowed. Even so, sensitivity was apparent, with some of the gracefulness of this subject realised.  There was bounce in the staccato notes, with dynamics explored in ’Spooky Wood Hollow’. Bolder shaping of the phrases was desirable, despite this, and not all the swing rhythms were sufficiently relaxed and controlled. Although further suspence awaited capture, forward flow remained assured.  The tone sounded natural and unforced, with a good range of articulation displayed. Despite this, greater contrast in colour and mood was required between the two pieces, with even deeper engagement in the music and subject matter necessary. Tempo choices were well judged, nonetheless, with some buoyancy conveyed.  This was a delightful performance, with some poetry sensed. Enjoy exploring the wonderful world of piano music!"
NRrbDxBR,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Idylle,Cecile Chaminade,Movement de valse,Louise Farrenc,85,"There was a lyrical legato flow to the Idylle, supporting the musical mood very effectively. More pointing of some phrases, rise and fall in the shaping and pliancy in tempo would have enhanced the style even further, but the balance and pedalling were very well managed and the overall style was conveyed.  A lightness of touch and the elegant tempo choice were strengths in the Mouvement de Valse. Dynamic contrast was effectively conveyed. There was a little unevenness in the rhythmic flow in the later stages but a suitably graceful feel to the playing.  You captured the tone and mood of your chosen pieces very effectively, and although further stillness was possible at the end of each piece, there was an assured poise in this performance.  An excellent performance with a sense of engagement coming across in your playing."
NYBARegg,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Vivace,Muzio clementi,The song of twilight,Yoshinao Nakada,74,"Buoyancy was catured in the Vivace, with forward flow assured. The playing was a little one-coloured at times, however, with further variation between repeated phrases desirable. Although bolder shapes were possible, the pulse retained focus, with the mood lively.  ’The Song of Twilight’ displayed controlled co-ordination, with the tone natural and unforced. Bolder contrast between the sections was necessary, despite this, and the left hand chords were too dominant, with their over-vigorous touch and rather metronomic feel disturbing the all-important calm. Some of the essential cantabile was explored, nonetheless, with the tempo well chosen.  A good range of articulation was explored in this performance, though bolder contrast in colour and mood was required between the two chosen pieces. Deeper engagement in the music was needed, and there was scope for further detail and shape in both the melody and accompaniment, but the quality of tone was commendable. Forward flow proved reliable, with tempo choices secure.  There were a number of positive attributes to your playing, with an ability to communicate vitality. Well done!"
NebeyZYa,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Indigo Moon,Elissa Milne,Jazz Exercise No. 2,Oscar Peterson,67,"There was dynamic ebb and flow in ”Indigo Moon” which suited the lyrical nature of the music well. This was at its most effective when it underpinned the general rise and fall of phrases, but there were some overdone moments of rubato where the sense of line was less clear, as rhythms became less attached to the pulse. Though more consistent balance between authenticiy and contrast was needed, notes and rhythms were secure throughout and there was a lot of colour in the playing.  The Peterson was bold in projection and notes were generally in place, allowing the jazzy harmony and melodic line both to pervade. Rhythms needed to be much more precise and comfortable in flow, though, with pulse not sufficiently firm for the essential underlying groove of the jazz style to be in place. This made for quite an inprecise performance rhythmically, with inconsistent tempo, but there was plenty of pitch accuracy and character in the use of emphasis, variety of articulation and shaping.  Your performance had focus and was consistent in terms of its overall sequence, with genuine expressive intent coming across, particularly in the first of the two pieces. Though the jazzy style of the Peterson was not fully grasped, there was clear engagement with the lyrical nature of the Milne and this was supported by mostly accurate notes and a wide dynamic range.  Thank you very much for sharing your playing! It was enjoyable to hear, and I send my best wishes to you for continued fuilfilment in your piano studies."
NjGwjlwy,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Prelude in C minor, BWV 999",Johann Sebastian Bach,Etude No.1 (From 10 Etudes),Philip Glass,68,"The Bach was safely played with a steady momentum throughout. Fingerwork was tidy and even and tonal control was clear. However there was room to develop greater voicing and build the phrases more effectively; the harmonic structure could have been clearer. There was an assured feel for the overall direction though and the piece was brought to a neat close.  The Glass began dramatically and an appropriately bright pace was established. The momentum did flag as it progressed however and touch became uneven with heavy octave attack and uneven broken chord patterns. Some clear passage work was often evident though and voicing was generally well-projected through the busy texture.  Although there could have been more exploration of the differing styles of each piece, both were calmly presented with a sure sense of occasion.  I enjoyed your committed approach throughout. Well done!"
NleAVPYP,7-9,Up to Grade 5,"Prelude in C sharp minor: No.10 from 24 Preludes, Op.81",Stephen Heller,The Child that is Born on the Sabbath Day: from A Week of Birthdays,Richard Rodney Bennett,82,"The Predule was sophisticated within the opening, with the lines expressive, smooth and well directed. The parts were confidently balanced, with the pedal well controlled. The second section, where the left hand line took the semiquavers, had some loss of clarity and the need for tighter rhythmic control. Texturally, from this point there was some blurring of harmonies and the need for more careful consideration of the pedal. Phrases were still given room to breathe and despite the odd blemish of pitch, an appropriate atmosphere was created, and the ending was assured.  Bright and energised from the start, the phrases always moved with a sense of direction in the Bennett, with some effective, communicative shaping and musical involvement. The semiquaver passages needed to be more rhythmically robust, and the quavers that followed rushed forward a little. Although there needed to be more technical control in this piece, the parts were vibrant and persuasive in their expressive elements.  The performance itself was involved, as lines were confidently projected, and there was a sense of committment to the overall performance, aswell as clear pacing between pieces and poise during playing. The expressive and stylistic characteristics of each piece were purposeful and engaging, but the technical components needed a little more support and nourishment in parts. This was a communicative programme.  I really enjoyed the way you managed to get the instrument to speak so effectively and meaningfully in parts of the programme. Well done and thank you for playing."
NwkXAqXr,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Cloudy Day,Christopher Norton,Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammond,75,"Cloudy Day began at an energised tempo, and details of articulation were consistent. Changing rhythmic patterns in the right hand caused delay and there was scope for closer observation of dynamics overall. Moments of uncertainty were resolved and the end was carefully paced.   There was plenty of rhythmic resolve at the start of Spooky Wood Hollow, and the relaxed character was clearly enjoyed. Joining phrases was not always seamless in the second half, and changes of dynamic colour lacked definition. However, despite small lapses of evenness and control, musical ideas were obvious and stylish.  This was a carefully paced performance, with a sense of time and reflective space between pieces. There were a few uncertain moments to negotiate and room for more vivid musical detail overall, but a clear feeling of enjoyment and accomplishment came across.  Well done, this was a determined performance."
NylGpqnp,13-15,Grade 5 and above,The Watermill,Kahn,Scherzo,Beethoven,80,"The Watermill flowed with momentum and direction though the long lines. While control of texture and pedalling invited extra consistency, with greater projection and shaping of the tune called for, the romantic style was presented confidently, with most if not all semiquaver passages delivered evenly and accurately.  The Scherzo was suitably jocular in spirit, its different sections benefiting from a good variety of dynamics, articulation and accentuation. Not all instrumental control was as consistently acheved, with moments of less rhythmically even playing and a few crushed right hand semiquaver patterns. The best regions of the playing displayed wit and energy, fitting well with Beethoven’s early style.  The playing benefited from an assertive, purposeful presentation, with good speed choices, and the overall performance achieved suitable contrasts and interest. A little more time between items was called for, to help define the different musical characters, though interpretations often illuminated the two styles creatively. In delivery, while much was accurate and decisive, there was unevenness, along with areas of less well-defined textural control. A sense of outward communictaion and verve was good to observe.  Congratulations on an excellent all-round performance, and best wishes for your future piano playing!"
OKdWDkGJ,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Vivace,Muzio Clementi,The Song of Twilight,Yoshinao Nakada,80,"The Song of Twilight benefited from moments of flexibility, as well as reliability in notes and rhythms. Touches of pedal served it well, and there were welcome moments of expression to lift the account. A more subdued left hand accompaniment was possible, and further subtleties of phrasing could have added to its sense of atmospheric charm, though it flowed along at an ideal pace and concluded well.  The Clementi was solidly controlled, and was often if not fully accurate in notes. A dainty staccato touch served the classical style well, though there was room to explore further subtleties of touch and balance, to give it an even more vibrant character. The classical style won through well overall.  Style identities were clear across the two pieces, and this was an excellent overall presentation. Despite isolated lapses in accuracy, along with a call for further subtleties and nuances, the performance was well paced and contained moments of illuminated playing.  Many congratulations, and very best wishes for the future!"
OKqxWAJY,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Sunsets in Savannah,Randall Hartsell,Wallace and Gromit Theme,Julian Nott,77,"Sunsets in Savannah had a well judged tempo, allowing plenty of momentum in bars with quavers, and much of the pedalling was under control. There was a tendency to highlight the first and third beat of each bar, which impacted the direction of longer lines, and joining phrases sometimes lacked a seamless approach. However, the reflective mood was clearly delivered.  Wallace and Gromit Theme was immediately playful and details of articulation remained vibrant throughout. Balancing accompanying figures was not always persuasive and there was room for further urgency in the build up to the final bars. However, hands were confidently synchronised and the mischievous character was delivered.  This was a carefully paced performance, with time between pieces for reflection, and a firm grasp of the different styles. There was room for more obvious expressive shape and stamina in the first piece, and for further consideration of balance, but there was some feeling of performance commitment.  Well done. This was an often rhythmic and colourful performance."
ONWWNryw,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Nouvelle Etude No. 1,Frederic Chopin,Tarantella,Moritz Moszkowski,87,"The Chopin opened expressively, paving the way for a nuanced and fluid account which flowed with ease. Voicing occasionally lost clarity and just a little more power could have been found in the bigger moments to define the climaxes. However, this was assured and engaging playing.   The Moskowski was deftly articulated with a bright energy and fiery passagework. Slight harshness of attack on some of the accents marred the otherwise smoothness of phrasing in the minor sections, but overall there was a well-contrasted texture with much variety and interest. The lively tempo was beautifully managed to the very final note.   This was an accomplished presentation that showed a variety of moods and sounds. There was a calm commitment to the occasion which allowed the music to shine through.   I enjoyed the assured sense of communication. Well done on an exciting performance!"
OZwveKjw,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Sonata in D Kp.443,D.Scarlatti,Impromptu in B minor,Samuel Coleridge-Taylor,73,"The Scarlatti had a decisive, flexible appearance, with examples of sparkling fingerwork. Not all tempo variations proved as helpful to the sense of musical overview or baroque style, and a generally more settled pulse was needed. Note accuracy was good, and ornaments were integrated confidently into the musical flow, bringing a bright outlook to musical purpose.  The Impromptu had a good overall romantic feel to it, with contrasts in mood and dynamics giving a decisive appearance to the account. There were less reliable rhythmic aspects, and some of the rubato sounded somewhat over-done, impeding the music's grander sense of flow, though the right hand's descending triplet patterns were well played and an individual approach was good to hear.  The two pieces contrasted well, and moments of repose between items aided the sense of performance engagement. An expressive, creative impulse added well to the playing, though timing control proved less consistent overall, both pieces inviting a more settled underlying pulse. The best regions in each performance demonstrated dexterity and musical insight.  Congratulations on a very good performance!"
OZxpevxk,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Solfggietto,C.P.E. Bach,Impromptu in B minor No. 2 from Two Impromptu,Samuel Coleridge-Taylor,89,"Solfggietto was played at a brisk pace and had a clear sense of direction and purpose. The fingerwork was agile and well defined and the semiquavers were mostly even and well controlled. There were touches of shaping and colour in the phrases and this was a bright and spirited account.  The hands were well balanced and coordinated at the start of the impromptu, though the chords did not always sound together in the right hand. The semiquaver passages moved along lightly and the rhythmic patterns remained poised. Note placing was reliable and the phrases had shaping and suitable dynamic contrast.There were touches of tonal variation with some depth found in the bass. The melodic line, in the more lyrical middle section, was given projection and tonal warmth, though the chords were not always quite coordinated in the accompaniment. The delivery was reliable though and the account was expressive and stylish.  The programme was suitably contrasted and showed technical facility and musical awareness. A range of tonal qualities were explored and fingerwork showed agility in both pieces. The sense of presentation was outward and communicative, and this was excellent and accomplished playing. Bravo!"
ObQmJDbe,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Bluebird,Alexis French,Sonato In G,Frank Joseph Haydn,81,"Bluebird flowed well from the outset, at a suitable tempo, with some expressively phrased moments.  The LH chords were a little too prominent in the texture at times, with room to project and shape the melodic material more fully overall, but all was securely in place, with the sustaining pedal warming the tone.  Sonata in G was taken at a well-chosen tempo and was colourfully contrasted in articulation and dynamics from the outset.  There was room to lighten the LH at times, and there was a slightly melodically inaccurate moment, but this was otherwise securely played, with the character largely conveyed.  This was an engaging and committed performance of two effectively contrasted pieces.  Poise was maintained throughout and there was a sense of communication.  Characterisation drew on a range of contrasts in dynamics and articulation, with just room to balance textures more carefully, and delivery was largely controlled throughout.  An excellent performance - well done."
OdQGrPLr,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Moderato,Attrib.Ludwig van Beethoven,Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammod,72,"The tone was bright and the tempo suitably sprightly in the Beethoven with some contrasted articulation. The melodic line needed more projection alongside clearer dynamic terracing, but the notes danced along breezily.  A crisp LH staccato was well sustained in Spooky Wood Hollow and you showed a grasp of the narrative though coordination and rhythms needed to be tighter in the outer sections. There were sporadic smudged notes and slips and scope for more vibrant dynamic detail to really enhance the story telling but the softer tones were effective.  Overall there was an assured fluency to this performance and the styles were effectively contrasted, although there were further nuances in each musical character to explore.  You showed a clear sense of engagement in the music throughout the performance."
OgrRRQrP,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammond,Arabesque,Burgmüller,85,"Spooky Wood Hollow began with a clean, energised and crisp left hand line. The textures were well balanced, with the melodic interest confidently projected and the phrases moving with sense of direction and momentum. The rhythmic components and pulse were not always precise, and there was scope for more stylistic nuances, exploring a wider range of tonal colours, but the performance did create an appropriate mood, with notes secure.   A strong tone was present in the Burgmuller, and it moved with purpose and determination. The accents were strong the rhythmic character was well captured. There needed to be more control and clarity when the melodic interest moved to the left hand line, but some of the dynamic direction was communicative and the performance was committed.   There was a strong sense of poise and control when playing, and organised pacing between the individual items too. An appropriate mood was created within both pieces, conveying some stylisitc awareness, just leaving room for more lyrical and expressive portrayal overall. There needed to be even tighter control of rhythm and pulse, but the other technical demands of the programme were largely well met.   I really enjoyed how you transferred from silence before playing, to the sudden exploding characters of both pieces. They were bold and energised from the start, and really made me listen! Well done!"
OmnlVDEV,13-15,Grade 5 and above,SONATA IN B MINOR XVI:32,HAYDN,"PAGANINI ETUDE NO:5  ""LA CHASSE""",FRANZ LISZT,91,"The Haydn Sonata had a clear sense of engagement and stylistic involvement. Well paced, and benefiting from a vivid range of articulation and dynamic effects. Excellent dexterity and control supported the interpretation, with much accurate, even playing bringing the music to life. Though a very occasional note smudge and less crisply coordinated moment was heard along the way, much was impactful and musically rewarding.  La chasse contained much beautiful playing, and the rhythmic design of the music was captured with vitality. The octave section invited a little more impulsiveness and gusto, and the double-glissando effects could have been still more effervescent, though the performance contained a high level of artistry and technical dependability, bringing the whimsical charm of the music ably to the fore.  Both pieces benefited from an excellent level of control and musical conviction. While a few extra seconds of stillness between items was needed, the playing itself showed charisma and nimblness, bringing much character-giving detail forward in this imaginatively put together performance.  Bravo - much to congratulate here; very best wishes for the future!"
PAzwdYkw,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Vivace (Third movement from Sonatina in C, Op. 36 No.1",Muzio Clementi,T-Rex Hungry,Sonny Chua,66,"The Clementi had a bold attack with a mostly lively speed and some effective contrasts. Fingerwork was not always evenly controlled and several slips did intrude on the flow, with some misalignment of the hands. However the overall momentum retained its energy.  T-Rex moved forwards angrily with some furious chordal passages. Uneven-ness of execution did rock the momentum but the musical intent was clearly projected.  Each piece had it’s own character, despite the uncontrolled moments. Presentation could have been smoother with a greater sense of occasion and poise.  I enjoyed the focused approach and sense communication. Well done on achieving some good playing."
PKzLBdkZ,7-9,Up to Grade 5,La Donna e Mobile,Giuseppe Verdi,Yesterday,Paul McCartney,75,"’La Donna e mobile’ was approached with energy, and there was bounce in the touch. It was possible for the melody to sing with further shape and expression, however, and more variation and detail were required in the accompanying figures. Although there was an untidy moment near the end co-ordination-wise, dynamics were explored, and the dance element was alive.  There was variety in articulation in ’Yesterday’, with the tempo well chosen. The melody needed shaping with more fluidity and flexibility to support the all-important cantabile, despite this, and there was too much emphasis on marking the beat at times. Rhythmic error featured in bar eight where the left hand quaver became crotchets and this marred the conviction of the interpretation. Some contrast between the sections was achieved, nonetheless, with some thoughtful moments and intimacy realised which suited this song.  Confident forward flow was displayed in this performance, with effective use of dynamics in places, and energy was present. Despite this, more rhythmic precision was required at times, and there was room for finer detail and shaping of the phrases to support both the singing line and the accompaniments. Tempo choices proved secure, however, with rhythmic buoyancy captured, and the tone preserved clarity in the quite passages.  You have the ability to express subtle and contrasting changes of dynamics, together with moments of poetry and convincing vitality. Well done on an enjoyable performance!"
PQDgxjbe,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Waltz in Bminor Op.69 no. 2,Chopin,Willie Wagglestick's Walkabout,Brian Bonsor,82,"A warm cantabile tone was found for the melodic line at the start of the waltz, and the phrases were given sensitive shaping and touches of rubato. The left-hand chords were in place, though not always placed together, and the lilting dance style was clearly portrayed. There were some rogue notes in the left hand as the piece progressed, and the dynamic canvas could have been further explored, though the middle section showed some apt contrast. The observation of the repeats could have been met with rather more energy and contrast and the account became somewhat relentless. The overall line was maintained though, and something of the gentle and elegant style was conveyed.  The more rhythmic Brian Bonsor piece provided a clear and welcome contrast and the jaunty character was effectively portrayed. There were a couple of moments of rhythmic instability and loss of coordination, but touches of buoyancy and lift showed clear musical intent. The detailing was committed and there was some light and agile fingerwork shown in the right hand solo lines especially. The tempo was lively and well maintained and the account was descriptive and jovial. Super!  The programme was suitably contrasted and demonstrated musical awareness, and an understanding of differing styles.   There were some blemishes but the technical delivery was largely reliable and showed keyboard facility. The presentation ran slightly overtime due to the observation of all the repeats in the Chopin. Overall, the presentation showed musical awareness and there were signs of outward presentation and communication. Well done on an excellent performance."

Bach,80,"The Haydn began at a brisk pace and the touch was mostly light and agile, although there were occasional sudden overemphasised notes. There was some blurring in the sound as the pedal was not fully lifted, but the contrasting articulation added interest. The legato phrases were given shaping and the touches of lyricism were welcome. There was a little loss of definition in the quicker semiquavers at times but the technical delivery was reliable, and the playing was stylish and communicative.  The Bach Prelude had a gentle sense of flow and the tempo was suitably poised in this expressive interpretation. The trills were a little heavy, especially in the left hand, but the interplay between the parts was effectively managed. The phrases had shaping and tonal variation and something of the lyricism of the piece was portrayed. Note placing was reliable and rhytmic outlines remained poised in this gentle and refined account.  The programme was suitably varied and showed technical facility and musical awareness, with expressive detailing being effectively communicated throughout. There was a little loss of pedal control and some loss of clarity in the fingerwork but, overall this was outward and communicative. Well done on your excellent and engaging presentation."
PgMnaaKN,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammond,Arabesque (Burgmuller op. 100 no. 2),Friedrich Burgmuller,83,"Spooky Wood Hollow began with intensity and drama, brought out by incisive articulation and keen dynamic nuance.  Some of the rhythms needed slightly more evenness, and there was space for more flexibility in the phrasing but this was a characterful rendition, consistent in overall flow and direction.  Burgmüller's Arabesque needed a little firmer tonal consistency at the start, but you paced this well, and there was lightness and sparkle in the delivery of the theme.  The rhythmic figures required greater precision and control along the way, but note accuracy was largely assured.  Your playing showed a keen sense of style, and you engaged fully with the musical characters, to particularly vivid effect in the first piece of the programme.  Though the rhythms weren't always even enough, consistency of flow was assured and there was confidence exuded in the interpretations.  Well done on playing with such compelling character and vitality!"
PjLQwxgg,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Last Song,Alexis Ffrench,In the Groove,Mike Cornick,82,"’Last Song’ was expressive, with a warm tone and legato melody. Parts were carefully balanced, with fluid accompanying quavers; a few slips and rhythmic errors were unsettling, but continuity was maintained. Scope for more sustained chord passages in the middle, with pedalling sometimes rather clouding textures; room for some quieter dynamics overall, but there was convincing musical direction.  ’In the Groove’ had characterful melodic clarity and neatly placed chords. Mainly reliable continuity, apart from a few moments of unsteady pulse; a few inaccurate rhythms and note blemishes were not too disruptive. Overall there was some careful dynamic shaping, with the mood and style captured.  This was a musically shaped performance, with effective transitions between styles - though pacing between pieces was slightly hurried. Thoughtful musical details here, though room for wider dynamic variety; technical details were secure, apart from occasional rhythmic errors. Overall there was characterful and reliable continuity here.  I particularly enjoyed the lightness of touch you achieved in the Cornick."

There were slight coordination slips centrally and one slightly unrhythmic bar towards the end of the first section.  There was a little dynamic contrast but several of the ’piano’ markings were overlooked and these would have added more colour. The LH was crisply articulated which helped to convey the dance style in this spirited performance.  The sustaining pedal warmed the tone in Someone You Loved and this was played at an apt pace with notes in place, but for just a few slightly unrhythmic moments. Tempo changes were well managed and the middle section was effectively contrasted, although there was scope for more shape and projection in the melody elsewhere. The character was captured effectively in the lyrical playing.  Engagement and poise were maintained throughout the performance and the two pieces were very effectively contrasted and characterised, with stillness achieved between them, and a strong sense of communication overall.  A very good performance - well done!"
QAvOLDrW,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Tango for Two,Manfred Schmitz,Minuet KV5,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,74,"A positive approach to the Tango for Two, with a good grasp of the rhythmic shape, and energy and lift in the contrasted articulations. Although more might have been conveyed of the rise and fall in the melodic phrases, much was in place, with a confident fluency.  The Mozart Minuet flowed securely in the notes, and although the melodic line needed to sing out further and there was less even control of the rhythmic shape and pulse in the second section, a sense of the dance was conveyed with some shaping to the phrases.  The contrasting styles of the chosen pieces were understood and there was a poise and focus in the presentation overall.  I enjoyed the energy and positive approach to the Tango - well done."
QNlDzqyk,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Jazz Exercise No.2,Oscar Peterson,Indigo Moon,Elissa Milne,85,"The bright swing of the Peterson was clear from the outset, and you underpinned the rhythms with a strong and effective groove. Notes and rhythms were securely in place and there was stable, positive continuity to support them. Dynamic statements tended to be a little narrow in scope, with room for more shape and colour to set phrases in contrast with each other, though the ending was vividly emphatic. Articulation often supported the syncopations and there was tidy coordination between the hands.  The opening of ”Indigo Moon” was poignant, and here you found warm tone and reflective sound, which suited the music well. The pedal supported the harmonic foundation, with texture kept clear, and throughout there was plenty of balance between the parts, so that voicing could allow melodic lines to pervade. Expressively there needed to be more conviction, particularly as the music built up to and faded away from the central climax, with a sense of introversy and understatement here. Tonal colours would have benefitted from more exploration as well, but the flowing, lyrical nature of the music came across well and you paced the closing bars with musical insight.  Throughout the playing there was consistency in terms of technical control, pace and momentum, with just the expressive statements lacking more telling, overt depth and range. There was successful characterisation of the lively jazz style of the first piece, and the wistful ballad character of the second.  Thank you for sharing your performance - it was enjoyable to be your audience! All the best for your continued music-making."
QPnPbVdX,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Allegro 1st movement from sonatina in C op.20 no.1,Friedrich kuhlau,Watchman's song,E.H. Grieg,72,"The Kuhlau performance benefited from an enterprising pace and examples of dexterity, bringing the music’s spirited character to life. There were a few rhythmic inaccuracies, as well as uneven semiquaver running passages, though the music’s sparkling character won through overall. Scope remained for further subtleties and refinements of the classical style, though you brought out its drama with a bold attack.  Watchman’s Song was well paced and revealed welcome glimpses of the romantic style, with contrasts heard across the sections. Sustain pedal could have been more liberally used, for expressive smoothness, and a still more rhythmic feel was needed during the contrasting middle section, though the best areas of the performance were better balanced and musically controlled.  Both pieces benefited from musicality and well gauged speeds. Though there was a call for greater finesse and smoothness of line overall, the playing demonstrated commitment and involvement.  Very best wishes for a musical future!"
QjlJDjJM,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Willie wagglestick's walkabout,Brian bonsor,il porco Rosso from porco rosso,Joe hisaishi,61,"’Willie Wagglestick’s Walkabout’ saw tonal brightness, with the melodic line well projected. Tempo variation was too great, however, a stable pulse not maintained which impacted on the rhythmic character, despite some dynamic variation and a good degree of overall pitch accuracy.    The Hisaishi maintained a convincing legato tone, and some of the contrasts between sections were noted. Further harmonic clarity was needed, and dynamic shaping was somewhat limited, despite more variation in the closing section. Rhythms were not consistently secure, although some elements of rubato were appropriate initially, and pitches were securely under the fingers.    You played with a sense of focus and composure in the overall performance, and although futher tonal shaping along with more rhythmic stability would have enhanced the differentiation of styles, melodic tone remained clear throughout, with a sense of performance in place.    Thank you for your entry. I enjoyed your sense of conviction and commitment, and wish you all the best for future musical ventures."
QlLYjEvP,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Rumba Toccata,Paul Harvey,Scherzo,D.B.Kabalevsky,79,"The Rumba Toccata was spirited and full of energy from the outset, with the accents very well pointed and the ’brilliance’ effectively conveyed. There were a number of slight smudges in note accuracy and some slowing in the scales towards the end, but the style was grasped and the character strongy conveyed.  The Scherzo was crisply articulated at the start and taken at a lively pace, with flexibility in the tempo as appropriate to the style. There were a few melodic smudges which affected the overall accuracy, but the tone was colourfully varied throughout and there was a consistent sense of energy and momentum.  This was an engaging and committed performance, with poise consistently maintained, and very strong communication throughout. The pieces were similar in tempo and overall articulation; two more contrasting styles would have created a more varied performance, but this was colourful and characterful playing throughout.  Congratulations on a very good performance!"
QpelDLNJ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Le coucou (Rondeau): first movement from Troisieme suite,Louis-Claude Daquin,The Watermill,Esther Kahn,76,"Le coucou had a suitably bright and even touch, with ornaments adding welcome sparkle. A sense of dialogue came through, the cuckoo regularly making its songful presence clear. There was room to vary the dynamics and touch more creatively, to bring the music from the page even more communicatively, though phrases were turned musically and repeated notes sounded clearly.  The Watermill had progression and examples of a colurful dynamic palette. Not all semiquavers were as evenly transitioned between the hands, with an occasional note error and stumble heard latterly. The approach was musical, with pedal added helpfully, though the overall pianissimo effect needed extra enterprise. The playing ended with welcome poise.  In both pieces there was creativity, the best playing demonstrating insights and instinctive phrasing. While extra verve and technical ease were achievable, along with a more daring dynamic palette, the playing overall showed conviction and a clear sense of enjoyment.  Congratulations, and very best wishes for a musical future!"
QrKmLVnN,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"The Storm, Op. 109 No. 13",J. F. F. Burgmuller,Last Song,Alexis Ffrench,77,"Tidy management of the rhythms was achieved through much of ’L’Orage’, with the overall flow also assured. A more spirited pace would have enhanced the sense of character, as would more defined phrasing and musical contours. The quietest and loudest moments could also have afforded more tonal nuance, needing more suspense and authority respectively, but some of the detail was clearly noted and the notes were securely managed.  Use of colour showed a grasp of the musical mood in ’Last Song’. The shaping was mostly quite subtle in effect, with some note slips around the midpoint. The legato could also have been more seamless overall, but was generally well sustained, leaving room to find a less measured approach to the rhythms to bolster the expressive effect.  This was a focussed performance, totally sincere and committed in approach. The expressive elements of both works needed more clarity, with opporunity to bring out their rhythmic and tonal characteristics in particular more thoroughly. Regardless, they were assuredly delivered, the technical aspects reliably controlled.  Well done! A very good performance which demonstrated solid technical skill and an admirable degree of personal determination. I sincerely hope you continue to perform to more audiences in the future, to develope further musical skill and share what you have already achieved with others!"
RKedPYva,16-18,Grade 5 and above,SONATA K.545,MOZART,PORTALS,ALAN SILVESTRI,68,"The Mozart was played at an appropriate tempo initially, much of the semiquaver movement fluent and even, its articulation precise.  However, pulse stability was not maintained across the course of the movement, particularly when the left hand took the semiquavers, and although the melody continued to project, there was scope for greater dynamic contrast and musical shaping of the line.  Nevertheless, this was an accurate account in terms of its pitching, with tonal brightness maintained.  The contrasting textures of 'Portals' were defined, and initial flourishes were confidently and accurately played.  As the piece progressed, greater tonal shaping of the line was needed to give a further sense of direction, and later semiquaver movement lost clarity of articulation.  However, repeated notes in the final section were clearly defined, and the drama of the music was in place.  This was a confident performance which saw focus throughout.  The second piece was more convincing in terms of technical security and stylistic conviction, with limitations in dynamic variation having an impact on the overall performance.  However, you played with  good degree of pitch accuracy, tonal weight in your second piece appropriate.  Congratulations on your good performance.  I enjoyed the drama of your second piece in particular."
RLnEDnnr,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Last Song,Alexis Ffrench,The Bounce,Zoe Rahman,87,"This was an expressive performance, delivered with obvious stylistic ideas from the opening note of Last Song. The soulful melody was carefully balanced, and flexibility in the shaping highlighted more unexpected harmonic moments. There was an occasional error and room for even more delicate softer playing, but musical intentions were always clear.   The Bounce swung along with purpose, at a spirited tempo. You clearly enjoyed the syncopated style, and some of the articulation was consistent. Details of dynamics lacked sparkle and tempo indiciations were not always followed, but this was a confident performance, delivered with determination.   The contrasting musical styles were clearly defined, and this was an expressive performance. There was scope for more considered pacing, with a long gap before the first piece, but little respite before The Bounce, and for further exploration of dynamic colour. However, stylistic ideas were obvious and were always delivered with determination.   Congratulations on an excellent performance, and best wishes for future success and enjoyment."
ROPMXDQj,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Sonatine Op55 No1 - Vivace,F.Kuhlau,The Song of Twilight,Florence B.Price,83,"Bold and confident from the start, the melodic interest was well balanced within the Kuhlau and there was some effective use of articulation. Hands were largely well coordinated and phrases always moved with a sense of direction. The pulse was not always robust and there was scope to capture the Vivace marking with more energy and pace in parts. The performance was assured and engaging though, with notes accurate in pitch and the shaping vibrant and communicative.  A soft and delicate sound was present in The Song of Twilight, with phrases smooth and some dynamic contouring. Parts were not always precisely coordinated and there was scope for the chords to be more sensitive in their tone. Although there was room for the lyrical components of the character to be more persuasive, exploring a wider range of tonal sonorities, an appropriate mood was created.  There was a strong sense of poise and control during the playing, and the programme was varied and suitably contrasting. There needed to be tighter coordination of the parts, and there was room for more careful balancing, but on the whole the technical demands of the programme were largely well met.  I particularly enjoyed the colour and involvement within the first piece - this was very vivid playing! Well done!"
RQpwkyDJ,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Thunder in Drought Season,Chen Peixun,Prelude no2 Voiles from Book 1,Debussy,76,"The Prelude established an appropriate sense of timelessness and you explored the sound world thoughtfully. There was a loss of synchronisation in the chordal work at times but you shaped the long lines gracefully and carefully. There was a need for further clarity in the articulation at times but it built effectively to its climactic moments. The tone was not always consistently controlled, with room for still more sonority in the projection of melodic material, but the use of rubato was both expressive and stylistically convincing.  A very brisk tempo was set for your ’Thunder in Drought Season’ and there was great verve and energy in your interpretation. Quite a few notes were rather skimmed over in your haste and whilst there was vivid use of dynamic detail, some of the phrasing detail was hampered by the ambitious pace. Nevertheless the drama and vibrant character of the piece was effectively captured.  The programme was presented in an assured and unhurried manner, with appropriate space being afforded in between items. From a technical perspective there was a need for more rhythmic clarity and precision at times, with a tendency to hurry in the second piece causing note ’splashes’ to occur. However there was a strong level of stylistic awareness and you provided vivid characterisations of the two contrasting styles. The performance overall conveyed a welcome sense of musical commitment.  Well done on some colourful and musically-connected playing!"
RRRergEQ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata in D, Kp.443,L.418",Domenico Scarlatti,Juin: Barcarolle: no 6 from Les saisonsL.66,Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,81,"The Scarlatti achieved a very good level of stylistic engagement, with much accurately conveyed and ornaments well installed. A little more vigour in the pacing, along with extra clarity of rhythmic direction could have assisted, and repeated notes needed a lighter, more sparkling quality to bring the harpsichord style of the music even more readily to the fore. These points aside, the performance contained helpful variety of dynamics, its best areas illuminating the music ably.  The Tchaikovsky had a projected melodic line and a mostly good sense of mobility. Room remained for a more finessed touch and for extra tonal gradation, with pedalling at times clouding the textures more than was helpful. The main climax was targeted with verve, and expressive qualties were well established. A small tendency to dwell at bar lines impeded the flow, though the performance held much interest, and despite an occasional hesitation and lapse in authority, it was well performed.  The playing captured the different style identities well, demonstrating a confident and purposeful approach. Much was accurate and decisive in appearance, though extra lightness and finesse with touch and tone could have further supported the interpretations. There was evident sincerity and sense of involment to commend overall.  Many congratulations, and very best wishes for a musical future!"
RYYLWzlD,7-9,Up to Grade 5,"Theme, Var.  1 and Var. 5 (from 12 Variations on ""Ah vous dirai-je, maman"", K.265)",Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,Summer's Dream,Catherine Rollin,88,"The Mozart Theme and Variations showed stylish detail from the start - the theme was placed with care and apt simplicity, articulated with precision, and the more florid approach to the variations brought appropriate character. There was scope for a little more rhythmical evenness at times, and the phrasing would have benefited from greater flexibility of shape, but there was reliable note accuracy upheld throughout.  Catherine Rollin’s Summer Dream was by contrast expressively smooth, supported by warm use of the sustaining pedal, and you brought out colour and richness in the sound. The melody was mostly lyrical in its projection, though there were moments along the way when more effective balance was possible, but for the most part this was a reliably flowing account.  Poise in the presentation, and expressive insight were key elements in your performance, and you played with almost fully dependable technical control, with just scope for more evenness of rhythm and nuanced balance. Otherwise the two works were effectively balanced and you engaged effectively with the styles and moods.  Congratulations on such assured playing, sensitively defined throughout!"
RedeNMvd,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Jester's Jig,Chee Hwa Tan,Love theme,Catherine Rollin,69,"Firm forward impetus was maintained through the ’Jester’s Jig’, even despite note slips in the first half and some generally loose rhythms, showing positive commitment. The second half could have been more musically balanced, but there was apt use of both colour and attack which showed a grasp of the musical idea.  A poised, warm opening to ’Love Theme’ set up the musical mood well. The shaping generally needed a more subtle effect, with the roles of each hand not as clearly differentiated as was possible. Still the structure of the piece was evidently understood, and it was secure in both its notes and flow, with the middle section finding more apt rhythmic impetus.  Sincere, committed and invovled playing. Control of faster moving rhythms and of tonal balancing would have brought more musical clarity to both works, but their general musical moods were clear, and a more personal connection with the music was apparent in the second piece.  Well done, this was a good performance! I hope taking part gives you the confidence to go on performing to others in the future, to share your clear musical abilities and your particular afinity for Catherin Rollin’s ’Love Song’."
RmEeZWZq,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Notturno,Dennis Alexander,Fountain In The Rain,William L.Gillock,80,"The tranquil mood of Notturno was immediately captured and the tempo was well judged. This was quite expressively shaped, though joining phrases was not always seamless, and there were many missed points of musical detail, especially of dynamics and changes of tempo. However, the end was especially well paced and brought this performance to a peaceful conclusion.   Fountain in the Rain was obvious in stylistic intention and there was some careful pacing of bigger moments towards the end. Keeping a really firm grip on all semiquavers was more of a challenge from the middle, and there was a much wider range of dynamic colour available to explore. However, your enjoyment and desire to convey the colourful character of the music was clear.  This was expressive and well paced playing, with plenty of reflective space between pieces. Musical styles were contrasting and understood, though not all the finer detail was consistently delivered. Technical handling was not quite of the same level, but a sense of performance was maintained throughout.  A stylish and spirited performance, well done."
RnKZOPnx,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Gavotte,James Hook,A Song of Erin,Thomas Dunhil,83,"There was buoyancy and vitality captured from the start in the ’Gavotte’, and articulation achieved variety. Bolder contrast was desirable, however, and there was room for further detail and shape in the phrasing. Although a little more flexiblity was possible in places, forward flow remained assured. The tone sounded clear and unforced, with the dance realised.  Graded dynamics proved effective, with the pulse focused. It was possible for the melody to sing with a more fluid touch at times, despite this, with the approach sometimes a little metrononic in feel. Sensitivity was apparent, nonetheless, with some cantabile explored, and moments of real engagement in the music were evident.  Tempo choices were well judged in this performance, with sufficient contrast in mood displayed between the two pieces. Finer detail and a more assured legato were required to fully support the shaping of the melodies, however, and awareness of the longer musical sentences needed further devevlopment, but a good range of dynamics and articulation was commanded. A lively musicality prevailed, with energy communicated.  Bold use of dynamics in your playing kept the listener engaged, and the ability to ’sculpture’ the sounds was developing well. Thank you for such a delightful performance!"
RnZwobDX,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Jester’s Jig: No. 7 from A Royal Birthday Celebration: Suite in Baroque Style,Chee-Hwa Tan,Winds In The Willows,Bernadette Marmion,79,"The Tan was lightly projected and the patterns moved from hand to hand with momentum. There was sufficient energy in the tempo to convey the ’jig’ nature of the piece, though rhythms needed to be more consistently tidy with a tendency for quavers to lose their stability at times. Pulse was well sustained, though, and despite there being room for more overt dynamic changes, to bring purposeful direction to the phrases, the articulation contrasts and security in the notes resulted in successful characterisation.  The Marmion was effectively calm and lilting in outlook, with a well judged tempo and good balance between the projection of melodic and accompanimental parts. There was room for more assured coordination at times, so that phrases could ebb and flow with more lyrical shape and controlled voicing, but notes were all in place and the pedal was particularly effective in supporting the expressive, often nuanced playing. The ending was sensitively done.  This was a well paced performance of two very contrasting pieces, and in the second you showed much expressive insight, achieving a natural and persuasive flow. Rhythmic issues affected the consistency of the delivery in the first piece, but still the mood and nature of the music came across, with good continuity sustained across the programme.  Well done and thank you for sharing your performance! It was enjoyable to hear."
RnndVvrg,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Allegro (First Movement from Sonata in F, K. 332)",W. A. Mozart,O polichinelo,Heitor Villa Lobos,74,"A suitably bright tempo was in place for the Mozart and this was delivered with a confident buoyancy. Chords could have been more neatly articulated though and trills tended to disrupt the momentum. There was space to cultivate further tonal control to achieve the elegant style more fully, but there was always clear shape and contrast to the account.  Exciting chordal passagework characterised the Villa-Lobos. This was an assured performance which was presented with much energetic flair.   Softer colours could have been further employed to broaden the dynamic range and add to the well-structured phrasing.  A varied programme, the differing moods were fully captured. The second piece was especially engaging.  I enjoyed the musical commitment. Well done on attaining a very good level of playing."
RpPjADGg,13-15,Grade 5 and above,RONDO ALLA TURCA,MOZART,IL POCO ROSSO,JOE HISAISHI,79,"Rondo alla Turca had a well chosen tempo and sense of stylistic engagement. Much was accurate and tidily coordinated between the hands, contrasting well across the unfolding sections, though additional vibrancy and operatic drive were needed during the rousing final lines of the music, where an occasional note error was heard. Overall, this was committed and often characterful playing.  In the Hisaishi performance there was a clear sense of purpose and a grasp of the music's jazzy, sentimental character. Not all was as accurately played, with unease in the delivery impeding one or two sections, such as the change of key centrally. Nonetheless, the best areas were colourfully projected, and a clear affinity with the music was on display.  This was a well paced performance, containing good musical insights and a solid if not fully consistent technical delivery. While accuracy was at times less securely achieved, the main style identities of the two pieces were capably illuminated, containing examples of strong expressive shaping.  Much to congratulate - very best wishes for the future!"
RwZWRXem,16-18,Grade 5 and above,In the Groove,Mike Cornick,Moonlight Sonata (First movement),"Ludwig van Beethoven Op.27, No. 2",65,"’In the Groove’ caught the cheerful mood well, featuring crisp and purposeful articulation. There was a need for a more consistent pulse running through the piece, with uneven counting around the syncopations tending to unsettle the natural flow of the swung rhythms. Further variations in tone colour could have been sought but there was nevertheless an instinctive sense of shape to the phrases.  The Beethoven adopted an appropriately unhurried tempo and the pedalling served to enhance the tone quality, if with occasional blurs of harmony in the process. The sombre mood was thoughtfully conveyed and a regular metre was successfully maintained, though for a fully expressive interpretation there was a need for further space to highlight key moments in the structure and in the changes of harmony. Whilst the melodic line could have soared more plaintively across the accompanying arpeggios you contoured the long phrases with care and the ominous swells in tone were effectively portrayed. Latterly there was a little rhythmical hesitancy around the LH dotted figures but for the most part the music flowed gracefully.  You presented the programme with a welcome calmness of approach, if with room for more sense of authority at the piano. The technical aspect of the playing showed good note accuracy overall although in the jazzy piece and latterly in the Beethoven there were areas of rhythmical unease. Textures were generally clear, if with occasional smudged harmonies in the pedal and a need for more penetrative melodic lines. The contrasting moods of the pieces were well grasped, with thoughtful shaping of phrases emerging, albeit with a need for further tonal detailing and for extra expressive intensity in the Beethoven. The performance as a whole was nevertheless musically committed.  Some enjoyable playing today and you caught the characters of the pieces well. Well done and good luck in all your future music-making!"
RxAEbJPP,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata Op.10 No.1 in c minor, 1st movement",L.v.Beethoven,Etude Op.10 No.12 'Revolutionary',F. Chopin,89,"The opening chords were suitably bold at the start of the Beethoven and the notes were mostly secure, though there was some harshness in the tone, and a little more depth would have been welcome. The dotted patterns were incisive and crisp and the rhythmic patterns were precise, though the rests were not always fully observed. The legato styling was not consistently smooth and maintained, but the lighter detached sections were suitably defined. Even more shaping and tapering could have been found but the account held a clear sense of style.    The start of the Chopin was suitably vibrant and projected and the chords were well placed. The tempo was vigorous and exciting, though this caused some loss of definition in the quicker left hand. The final flourish was impressively managed and coordinated and the grand style was effectively presented. Bravo!    A suitably contrasted programme showed stylish awareness, and the sense of presentation was outward and communicative. The introduction was clear and the pacing of the programme apt.   An excellent and engaging performance, well done."
VWaZvLak,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Giga in D,Elisabetta de Gambarini,Poetic Waltz,Enrique Granados,76,"The Gigue started neatly and at a fitting speed – with clear dynamic contrasts included as you progressed. Most of the ornaments were well controlled in their fingerwork. There was scope to provide clearer phrasing and further shape within the lines, with room for the left hand to be lighter on occasion to allow right hand quavers to sound out more fully still. There was full accuracy, though, apart from one brief loss of precise rhythm, and the dance character was very well communicated overall.  In the Granados you projected the tunes clearly for the most part, and there was due light and shade in dynamics. The ornaments weren’t all clear in their detail in the right hand, with room to enhance the cantabile style through further legato and greater line through the phrases. Nonetheless, in an accurate performance almost throughout, you conveyed something of the grace of the music.  You were clearly involved in the playing – a good sense of focus came across – and the two pieces were well differentiated in their characters. There was scope to allow the ends of each of them to settle more longer before moving, to add to the overall feeling of poise; there was still a sense of performance, though.  Well done on this very good performance. I especially enjoyed the dancing mood of the first piece. Best wishes for your music-making in the future."
VXoPAZdM,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Allegro, First movement from Sonatine Op.5",Anton Eberl,Silent and soft and slow descends the snow from Fantasies Book 2,Arthur Benjamin,70,"The tempo of the Allegro was carefully judged and captured the spirited character. Hands worked quite efficiently together, though not always with carefully adjusted balance, and grace notes tended to cause instability. Little of the refined musical detail was included, especially of dynamics and aticulation, but mishaps were generally well recovered.   Silent, Soft and Slow descends the Snow was nicely contrasting in character and the opening tempo was well judged. There were moments of instability in longer passages of detached quavers, and joining phrases lacked a seamless approach. There was definitely room for more dynamic colour and use of the una corda to fully capture the delicacy of the music. However, there was some feeling of expressive shape, especially in sustained passages.  This was a contrasting programme, with well judged tempi and efficient resolution of stumbles. Not all the musical detail was added, leaving room for further stylistic exploration, and there was limited space for reflection between pieces. However, your enjoyment was clear and was shared.  Well done and best wishes for future enjoyment and success."
VZEKxnlN,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata in G major, Op.31, No.1, 1st Movement",Ludwig Van Beethoven,"Moment Musicaux Op.16, No.4",Sergei Rachmaninoff,93,"There was much security and positivity in the playing of the Beethoven. Accurate and secure notes and rhythms were in place and momentum was well controlled, with appropriate tempo, though there was scope for a little more vitality to suit the vivace marking. Textures were very clearly managed, so that melodic lines in both hands came across well, and articulation was well varied, supported by tidy pedal use. Sometimes the style demanded broader statements in terms of contrast, emphasis and energy, with the playing sometimes feeling a little reserved in projection - for example in the transition from the development into the recapitulation. There was much dynamic variety and shape, nonetheless, and this was particularly noticeable in the coda where phrases were conveyed with insightful and poised design.  From the start the Rachmaninoff was emotive and expressive, and commendable dexterity in controlled the passagework ensured lots of clear texture. This supported a very melodic approach, and phrases felt authentic in their shaping and tempo. There were some slightly less controlled rhythmical moments in the passages where both hands had sextuplets, but even here the melodic lines pervaded well, with some splashes in the chord placements, but with adept and focused tonal colour. Expressively, this was a very mature account, supported by a wide dynamic range that did not become over-zealous, but successfully captured the mood of the music.  The performance was positive and well projected throughout, and there was a strong sense of occasion. The listener’s attention was held by your focused and musical approach, and there was consistency - if a little reticence in the Beethoven - of expressive scope and technical security. The playing was insightful and revealed particular stylistic and emotional understanding in the Rachmaninoff. Underpinning all of this was a secure technical foundation.  Well done on this outstanding performance. I enjoyed it very much."
VaRARAoR,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Spiritoso,Muzio Clementi,Toccata,Martin Cluellar,89,"Confident forward flow was captured in the Clementi, with the tempo lively. Further detail and shape were possible in the phrasing, however, and not all the notes sounded cleanly. A little more focus and control were desirable at times, with the tone often forced in the louder passages, but the style was realised, and there was effective use of contrasting dynamics.  The Toccata began with a bold statement, and variety in articulation was displayed. Engagement in the music was evident, though further expression was possible in the more lyrical middle section. Although even more pacing was required in the final section, a sense of drama was present. Fast repeated notes were clear in tone and attack, with the approach suitably energetic.  Both interpretations communicated vitality, with good command over a wide range of dynamics. Greater contrast between the two selected works was needed, despite this, and there was room for further poetry and finesse when more lyricism, as well as a more fluid touch, were demanded. Rhythmic vigour and dramatic sensibilities remained a strong point, nonetheless, with tempo choices well judged, and stylistic demands met.  There were displays of brilliance and conviction in your playing which were exciting and engaging for the listener. Enjoy your ever-expanding world of piano music!"

Dynamic terracing was present in the Trio although further tonal shaping was possible. Overall the style was understood and the notes confidently fluent.    There was a legato flow to Cloudscapes and the melodic line was largely well projected, athough more expressive shaing possible. Accompanying chords were sometimes rather bold in tone early on, but the haunting feel was more effectively captured in the later stages.  Assured memory supported an ease of flow in this performance with the contrasting styles clearly differentiated. There were more subtleties of style and expression to explore for fully persuasive characterisation, but there was a poise in the playing.   Well done on this excellent performance."
VklKmmXR,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Allegro,Domenico Cimarosa,Scherzo,D. B. Kabalevsky,84,"The Cimarosa was bold and energetic from the start, with a well judged, bright tempo underpinning strongly projected sound. There we some effective dynamic contrasts along the way, particularly in the middle section where clear terracing was evident. Rhythms were not always fully steady, with some blemishes in the coordination and the balance, at one point causing a very small note splash. Otherwise, notes were very secure and there was well sustained momentum.  The Scherzo was suitably lively in character with clearly and vividly detached articulation and very good control of the dynamic level. Contrasts were well managed and musically insightful, including some suitably ’scherzo-like’ humour at the end and moments of subtlety to contrast with the bolder playing. Small blemishes in the evenness of the tone tended to affect the louder parts, but plenty of very assured technical facility was on show.  You paced these two pieces really well and - despite them both having quite energetic characters - emphasised the differences in mood and style convincingly. The technical and tonal control was more secure in the second piece, but in both you played with sustained, clear pulse and plenty of dynamic light and shade.  Well done on this excellent performance, which I enjoyed hearing! I wish you continued enjoyment and success in your piano work."

There was room for finer shape and detail in the phrasing to achieve playing of total conviction, however, as well as even bolder contrast between the sections of the music, but the tone retained clarity. The style was realised, with technical demands well met.  There was bounce in the touch, and the rhythms were able to dance in the Bartok. Further spontaneity and colour were desirable, despite this, and a little more focus was required when the tempo slowed. Although more humour and playfulness awaited expression, vitality was communicated, with the tempo lively.  Assured forward flow characterised both interpretations, though there was scope for greater contrast in mood between the two chosen pieces. There was room for even deeper engagement in the music, and more charm and lyricism awaited capture, together with further joy and humour. Co-ordination retained focus, nonetheless, with a clear tone displayed, and tempo choices were well judged.  This was a fine performance, with buoyancy and vitality achieved. Keep up the excellent work!"
VqlNBybx,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Presto: third movement from Sonata No.6 in C minor,G. B. Pescetti,Billie's Song: No.7 from Portraits in Jazz,Valerie Capers,78,"A lively mood was captured in the Presto, and there was buoyancy in the touch. Further detail and shape were possible in the phrasing, however, together with further contrast between repeated material. Slightly unfocused co-ordination was audible, with more control desirable in places, but forward flow remained confident, and the tone possessed clarity.  'Billie's Song' explored some delicate colours, and there was effective use of graded dynamics. Even more expression and elasticity awaited capture, despite this, and there was scope for bolder shaping of the phrases. Although a little more flexibility was possible in places, the style was realised, with the tempo well chosen.   Both interpretations possessed vitality and buoyancy, with some poetry and a little intimacy expressed in the second item. Even bolder contrast in colour and mood awaited capture, however, as well as finer detail and a little more control to support playing of greater conviction. Tempo choices proved appropriate, nonetheless, with an ability to sustain assured forward flow, and a good range of articulation was achieved.  This was a delightful performance, with displays of energy and, at times, tenderness and delicacy, which is to be commended. Well done!"
VrbGdwXB,7-9,Up to Grade 5,The Ballerina,Ray Moore,Fountain in the Rain,William Gillock,86,"Your playing of The Ballerina was crisp and alert, bringing a vivid sense of the musical character to the fore. You phrased this neatly and there was assured flow and mostly even rhythmical control, and while there was room for a little more variety in the phrasing, for the most part you communicated a keen sense of the descriptive quality of the music.  Fountain in the Rain by contrast was florid and smooth, and sensitivity of tonal projection was ever-present. Some of the rhythms here would have benefited from greater evenness, but the sparkling quality of the music was compelling and there was a real sense of style, sensitively poised at the conclusion.  The presentation of both works brought variety and expressiveness and while more pliable shape was sometimes needed, the technical control was on the whole reliable. Communication was clear and focused.  Well done, this was stylish playing!"
VvYDbYWz,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Under The Stars,O. Krut,Stormy Night,Melody Bober,74,"Under the Stars had a lovely fluid quality to many of the quavers and efficient pedalling helped sustain longer lines. There was room for further shape and direction in the phrasing and dynamic opportunities were sometimes overlooked. More poignant moments did not always have sufficient impact, but the gentle and reflective character was well delivered.   You approached Stormy Night with purpose and there was energy in the tempo. Maintaining this in the coda was a challenge, and momentum sagged before the Da Capo. Holding on to minims became gradually less reliable and there was room for more vibrant dynamic colour to fully capture the changing moods. However, a clear feeling of enjoyment was conveyed.  This was a varied and carefully paced performance, with a good grasp of the different musical styles. Refined detail was not always vibrant or consistent enough, and the end of the second piece was less confident. However, your commitment and enjoyment was always clear to see.  Well done. This was a purposeful and cheerful performance."
VwxxzWaA,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Minuet in G,J.S. Bach,Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammond,87,"Minuet in G was fluently played at a lively tempo, capturing the elegance of the style in the varied and clean articulation. The left hand was not quite accurate melodically at the end, but notes and rhythms were otherwise in place, with just room to make more of the opportunities for dynamic contrast. A characterful performance overall.  The character of Spooky Wood Hollow was grasped from the outset in the crisp articulation and colourful dynamic contrasts. Notes and most rhythms were securely in place but for one missed LH pitch, and room for more consistently flowing swung quavers.   There was scope for more careful grading of some of the ’crescendi’ but this was stylish and colourful playing.  This was a vividly communicated performance, with the styles of the two contrasting pieces very effectively differentiated through the incorporation of much colourful musical detail. Engagement and poise were maintained throughout.   An excellent and very enjoyable performance."
WGbKrRRx,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Allegro: third movement from Sonata in C minor, C.68",Domenico Cimarosa,In the Groove: from 20 Piano Studies,Mike Cornick,80,"The Cimarosa Allegro began well at a suitable tempo and had a sense of energy and buoyancy from the outset, aided by the lightly and evenly articulated quavers. Not quite all the ornamental detail was convincingly managed and the hands could have been more carefully balanced at times, but idiomatic dynamic contrasts added colour and phrases were musically shaped.  An apt tempo was chosen for In the Groove and all was securely in place throughout, with some colourful contrast in the articulation. There was scope for a stronger sense of shape and direction overall, along with a little more energy, but something of the character was conveyed.  This was an engaging and committed performance with delivery largely controlled throughout and characterisation of the two contrasting pieces drawing on a wide palette of dynamics and articulation. There was scope for a little more communication but the pacing and sequencing were thoughtfully managed.  Congratulations on an excellent performance."
WNNZGxlD,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Entertainer,Scott Joplin,Waltz in B minor,Franz Schubert,76,"The playful character of The Entertainer was quickly established and most syncopated figures were evenly managed. There was room for an even more laid-back tempo, but changes of dynamic colour were effective, and hands worked efficiently together.   Schubert’s Waltz in B minor was carefully sustained and the shape of the melody was quite expressively steered. There was insufficient energy in the tempo for this to dance freely, and accompanying chords were a little strong overall. However, there was some consideration of dynamics and articulation, and the end was sensitively paced.  This was an assured performance, with space for reflection between pieces. The contrasting musical styles were understood, though there was room for even more refined detail, and for further urgency in the tempo of the Waltz. Your enjoyment, however, was clear and was shared.  This was a consistent and colourful performance. Well done."
WQoQaqNO,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Vivace, Third movement from Sonatina in C, Op. 36 No. 1",Muzio Clementi,The Song of Twilight from Piano Pieces for Children,Yoshinao Nakada,84,"The first piece had a suitable lilt from the start, phrases moved with a sense of direction and the melodic line was well balanced. There was scope to capture the Vivace marking with more rhythmic energy, and for the dynamic involvement to be more vibrant and communicative, but notes were reliable and the hands worked well together.  The Song of Twilight began with a delicate tone and the gentle mood was present. Notes were largely well coordinated, with just some uneveness of placement within the left hand chords. Phrases were arching and the tone was positive, with lines fluent, though there was room to explore a wider range of tonal sonorities, and to develop the lyrical and expressive components of the character more persuasively.  A strong sense of performance was conveyed as lines were clean throughout, there was poise and control, as well as a suitable pacing between the individual items. The different musical identities of the pieces came across effectively, just leaving room for more stylistic nuances and vivid portrayl overall. The technical demands of the programme were met with positivity.  This was an assured and well controlled performance. Thank you for playing."
WaNLzgGp,13-15,Grade 5 and above,IL POCO ROSSO,JOE HISAISHI,NO.2 FROM SIX BULGARIAN DANCE,BELA BARTOK,87,"The Hisashi benefited from a very good level of expressive clarity and brightness of tone, giving a suitably pronounced and colourful feel to the playing. Much of the rhythmic detail was convincingly done, despite a few less easily flowing moments and a call for extra ease at the key change. The different sections were given valuable variety, and moments of colourful sentimentality worked well in support of the laidback musical style, rounded off with a sensitive conclusion.  The Bartok had a driven and decisive feel to it, its irregular rhythmic patterns well integrated. Accents, dynamics and other stylistic features were ably integrated into the musical flow, with full accuracy achieved, though there was scope for a little more brilliance and drive. Many excellent articulation effects buoyed up the performance.  A clear sense of engagement and communication came through in the playing of these well contrasted items. While scope remained for additional consistency in the opening item, and for additional sparkle in the second one, the playing was accurate and much musicality came across overall. Moments of stillness between items were well gauged.  There was much to congratulate - very best wishes for a musical future!"
WgjLKqlA,7-9,Up to Grade 5,A rough sea shanty,Pam Wedgwood,Tarantella Twist,Victoria Proudler,77,"You brought an appropriately rustic sense of character to the playing of A Rough Sea Shanty which was firmly projected from the outset. The rhythmic figures weren’t quite even, and there was some slight bumpiness in the flow, but the decisive sense of direction was energetically upheld for much of the time, just needing a little more flexibility in shaping the phrases.  Tarantella Twist had a good feeling of ebb and flow in the lines, and you achieved positive dynamic variety as the piece unfolded. The quaver movement wasn’t quite steady and particularly towards the end there needed tidier synchronisation between the hands, but you always maintained a vigorous sense of engagement with the style of the piece.  Focused playing was upheld throughout the overall performance and you communicated a strong sense of musical character, even if more variety was possible in the phrasing. The rhythmical detail needed firmer control, but note accuracy was largely confident and you brought a feeling of conviction to your playing.  Well done on bringing such a positive sense of character to this exciting playing!"

Bach,Nocturne Op 9 No 2,Chopin,93,"The Solfeggietto was played with a good degree of technical assurance, fingerwork largely even and with clarity of articulation in place. Occasionally, hand alternation was not fully even, a slight tendency to rush evident, but throughout, the musical line was sensitively shaped, reflecting direction, and this was an accurate rendition.  The melody of the Nocturne was played with warmth and appropriate shaping, using both rubato and tonal graduation. Some of the dynamic changes were just a little abrupt, and chordal playing in the accompaniment was occasionally intrusive in the louder passages. However, ornamental flourishes were largely well managed, the passion of the style in place.  Overall, this was a convincing performance, musical details consistently observed, and with the contrasts of style in the two pieces evident. You played with clear stylistic engagement, allowing yourself to be transported by the music, and despite the scope for further tonal subtlety on occasion, this was a musical performance.  Many congratulations on this exceptional playing, and I wish you all the best for your future musical ventures."
WlowRDpA,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Ten Pieces for Piano from Romeo & Juliet, Op 75: VIII. Mercutio",Sergey Prokofiev,Funky Gecko,Susan Staples Bell,90,"The Prokofiev was suitably charismatic and vivacious, played with clear stylistic insight. An exceptional range of effects sustained musical interest throughout, with imaginatively controlled shifts between sections and crisp fingerwork on display for much of the way. Its giocoso spirit won through commendably well, and while there were occasional opportunites for still greater incisiveness and rhythmic vitality, the playing contained ample pizzazz and enterprise.  Funky Gecko was presented with much energy and commitment, capturing the music’s groovy spirit convincingly. Accents and other character-giving details added splendidly to its overall sense of grittiness and authortiy, though an even more settled pulse was needed, with a few instances of clipped beats heard, for example during the opening bars. Technical aspects were well under control, and a clear sense of involvement brought it confidently to life.  The performances demonstrated commendable conviction and command, with much stylistic insight brought across and technical resources put to valuable use. While isolated moments of rhythmic imperfection occurred, and room remained for even bolder contrasts to fully define the two genres, this was exceptional piano playing.  Bravo - very best wishes for your onward journey!"
WnvlLodQ,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Billie's Song,Valerie Capers,Mouvement de valse,Louise Farrenc,74,"’Billie’s Song’ had positive rhythmic flow, the approach suitably unhurried, finding moments of flexibility along the way. In terms of legato it could have afforded further refinement, textural blurring and quite prominent left hand chords limited the sense of smoothness and tonal clarity. Whilst not vividly shaped, there was a range of colour and the notes were assuredly managed.  The ’waltz’ element came through well in the Farrenc, both in the well judged tempo and the apt articulation. It was less persuasive in its attack in the loudest points, with room to balance melody and accompaniment more musically overall. A momentary slip around the reprise was well recovered though and it had a range of characterful detail elsewhere.  A committed and determined performance, showing a firm grasp of the different musical moods within each piece. More awareness of the roles of each hand would have enhanced musical clarity, as would more controlled use of the pedal and articulation generally. Whilst a genuine sense of confidence was not always achieved, there was clear personal involvement with the playing.  This was very good playing! I thoroughly admire how well you paced both of your pieces, this being a clear indicator of your understanding of the different musical styles, supported by generally apt articulation too. Keep performing!"

Richard Harris","George Gershwin, DuBose Heyward, Dorothy Heyward, Ira Gershwin",85,"Your performance of Bach’s Invention in F was energetic, providing compelling impetus from the opening bars. Crisply articulated and with attentive phrasing, you engaged well with the musical style. The rhythmic patterns weren’t always fully even, creating some moments of imprecise ensemble, but the overall pulse and flow was upheld with regularity, and this was robust in its projection.  The arrangement of Gershwin’s It ain’t necessarily so brought an easy sense of flow to the fore, capturing the relaxed style effectively, while dynamic nuance added variety as the piece unfolded. The middle section was slightly more angular, but elsewhere you showed expressive insight, just needing more consistency of flow at one point where there was a small stumble.  You showed focus and commitment in your playing and a good feeling of poise was ever-present. The two works were vividly contrasted, and musical sensitivity was always clear, and for the most part this was technically secure, despite slight unevenness in the Bach.  Confidently expressive playing - well done on a fine performance!"
WpoYbvxY,10-12,Up to Grade 5,AVE MARIA,Burgmuller,TRUMPETER'S SERENADE,Fritz Spindler,89,"Ave Maria was played at a gentle pace with sensitive tonal colours. there was some uneven pulse in the first section and the melodic line needed further projection initially, but the pacing overall had a calm poise and the rise and fall in dynamic was expressively controlled to support the musical mood.  There was a crisp buoyancy and energy in the staccato articulations of Trumpeter’s Serenade and the hands were well balanced. Most of the RH notes had rhythmic clarity and dynamic detail was present, although more vibrancy possible to heighten the later contrasts. A positive sense of momentum was sustained.  An assured performance with reliable memorising of the notes and musical ideas of interpretation whcih supported the contrast in character between the chosen pieces. More stillness when playing the final phrases of each piece, and at conclusion, would have enhanced further the overall impact of the performance.  A clear sense of involvement with the different musical styles was evident in this playing, with particular sensitivity in the pacing of Ave Maria."
WyGpbLPm,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Gymnopédie No.1,Erik Satie,Velocity Op.109 No.10,J.F.F.Burgmuller,86,"Gymnopédie achieved a poised presentation with a well chosen, maintained speed and often soundly gauged balance between the hands. Pedalling was tidily done, and there was expressive shape to hold musical interest in this accurate, often tidily coordinated account. Scope remained for greater finesse and tonal sensitivity, to draw out the music’s serenity and expressive detail even more convincingly, but this was a thoughtful, controlled performance.  Velocity demonstrated dexterity and excellent technical control, with a suitably enterprising tempo and helpful accentuation included. While isolated bars contained less crisply coordinated playing, and room remained for still greater contouring and variety of effect, this was accurately presented, containing much sparkle and vitality.  Much of the playing was excellent, both in technical control and interpretive detail, and the two pieces contrasted convincingly. While an occasional area of less persuasive control was heard, and scope remained for an even wider palette of expressive ideas, the performance overall came together robustly, with suitable repose on show when transitioning between items.  Congratulations on this excellent performance, and very best wishes for a musical future!"
WzgnRoXL,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Presto,G. B. Pescetti,Pentatonic Tune,Bela Bartok,82,"The Presto flowed with ease and clarity from the outset; your well-chosen pace was neatly maintained and there was some neatly detached left-hand articulation which gave this energy. There was room for bolder dynamic changes and phrases could have been closed more elegantly towards the end, but an effective sense of style was apparent.  Pentatonic Tune was played with vigour and a suitably light touch. Some smudgy corners did appear and the dynamics were a little less convincing towards the latter part. However the tempo differences were under control and there was a strong dancing spirit throughout.  Assured playing and a well-measured presentation gave this performance a sense of occasion. Whilst some further tonal variety could have been explored, I enjoyed the bold attack to each piece.  Bravo on some excellent playing."
WzvKVmAp,13-15,Up to Grade 5,The Sad Ghost,Nancy Litten,T-Rex Hungry,Sonny Chua,75,"The Sad Ghost contained many positive musical ideas and a sense of direction up to the high point on the second page. There were rhythmic imprecisions, which impeded its sense of solidity, and hurrying detracted from the music’s grander overview further along, though note accuracy was good, and an encouraging level of creativity and variety drew out the music’s doleful character.  T-Rex Hungry achieved a thoughtful, measured presentation, with examples of nimble fingerwork and variety of touch. It called for extra dramatic impulse and dynamic contrasts, to bring the music from the page more resoundingly, and there were isolated spots of less rhythmically coordinated playing, with the final chords presented at half speed, but a sense of engagement with the music was clear, with a well chosen tempo.  The music contrasted well, and a clear sense of engagement came through overall. While rhythmic aspects were not always as solidly rooted, and extra enterprise with effects and contrasts could have further enhanced the playing, note accuracy was consistently reliable and there was suitable stillness when transitioning between items.  Well done on a very good all-round performance, and best wishes for the future!"
XAjMmmel,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Allegro assai: third movement from Sonata in G,Georg Benda,"Wallace and Gromit Theme: from Wallace and Gromit, arr. L'Estrange",Julian Nott,81,"A suitably lively pace was established in the Benda, with varied attack also giving character to the playing. This could have been enhanced by a stronger sense of elegance, both in terms of phrasing and the balance between the hands. There was room for even more rhythmic poise in the first half too, but it was assured in its overall flow and found more nuanced colour in its quietest moments.  Buoyant articulation was a stylish feature in the ’Wallace and Gromit Theme’, as was the energetic momentum. A slight hesitation just before the main theme returned later on briefly marred the flow, and there was opportuntiy to find a stronger sense of direction through each phrase generally. Whilst not fully refined in its balance, the tonal qualities were suitably bright and had some variety too.  An assured performance, fluent throughout, just needing further awareness of the roles of each hand and of musical phrasing to bring out the different characters more vividly. Further poise as each piece concluded would also have enhanced the sense of communication, but there was a little more panache at the end of the programme as a whole.  Bravo! I enjoyed this excellent, light-hearted performance, particularly the very ending of ’Wallace and Gromit’ where the musical detail came through very effectively. I sincerely hope you share your admirable technical skill and flair for lively musical characters in future performances!"

More vivid phrasing and shaping would have enhanced its expressive effect, but it was generally well balanced and assured in note accuracy.  A crisp, consistent staccato touch gave apt character to Kabalevsky’s ’Scherzo’. More subtle mangement of the secondary voices would have enhanced musical clarity, with some of the detail not evidently incorporated, notably the tempo variations at the end of each section. Regardless, it was entirely fluent and its quietest moments near the end found more nuanced colour.  This was an assured performance, and the technical delivery of both works was well managed. More personal stillness at the end of the Kabalevsky would have given a stronger sense of performnace awarness there, with scope to manage the expressive elements of the chosen works more consistently overall. Still they were well articulated and had moments of apt detail.  Bravo! I can only admire your dexterous fingerwork which contributed aptly to this excellent performance, especially in the ’Scherzo’. Best wishes in all of your future musical endeavours!"
XEYypZRX,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Invention No8 in F major,JS Bach,Sonatina Op55 no3 Ist movement,F Kuhlau,90,"The tempo in the Invention was sprightly and there was a lightness and buoyancy to the stylish articulation. Not all the coordination and balance between the hands was successfully controlled and there was scope for more shaping at times, however the pulse and sense of direction were well sustained and the ending was poised.  The Kuhlau had plenty of rhythmic energy at this lively pace and a suitably bright tone. Dynamic terracing and shaping of phrases was effectively stylish and the hands were largely very well balanced.  A confident fluency was assured in this poised and largely technically assured performance with a sustained sense of engagement in the playing.  There was especially effervescent RH fingerwork to enjoy in the Kuhlau - a spirited performance."
XJLkNOgz,16-18,Grade 5 and above,À la manière de Borodine,Maurice Ravel,"Sonata in A minor, K. 310, 3rd movement",Mozart,92,"The Ravel was played with a real sense of its lilting style, supported by assured tonal graduation of the syncopations, with the subtle tonal undulations convincing. There was scope for just a little more weight at the loudest point, with some of the central section not fully even in delivery. However, musical details were noted and this was a musical account.    The Mozart saw appropriate tonal lightness, supporting the style and with a good degree of technical security in place. There were occasions when further clarity of articulation and evenness of fingerwork would have supported delivery, particularly in terms of hand coordination and left hand quavers. However, although an even wider dynamic range was possible, the movement saw musical shaping to help reflect its structure, and despite the occasional blemish, more so latterly, this was a fluent and characterful account.    Throughout this performance, you played with confidence and composure, the sense of performance poise never lost. The contrasting styles were clearly defined, with tonal variation used to support this, and with musical shaping consistent across the course of the performance.    Many congratulations on this convincing and exceptional performance. I particularly enjoyed the Ravel."
XNLWbzxW,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Allegro Moderato,Joseph Haydn,"Snow, Moon and Flowers",Peter Sculthorpe,60,"In the Haydn, notes were generally in place and there was awareness of the need to pace the phrasing, affording moments of calm and poise to contrast with more intricate passagework. Right-hand lines were often bright and well projected, but there was inconsistency in managing the tone and texture, which impacted on the melodic line and its shape at times. Rhythmic control needed greater security; projection blemishes and unevenness affected some of the triplet detail - particularly in the development where the coordination between the hands was not always successful. Despite some reservation in terms of expressive breadth, there was dynamic light and shade, and awareness of the melodic contour came through. The decision to curtail the movement before the recapitulation caused significant imbalance; nonetheless, and despite the resultant lack of cohesion, the portion of the movement that was presented conveyed a good sense of the style.  The Sculthorpe was still and focused at the start, with gentle, soft tone and resonance from the pedal. The chosen tempo was somewhat reserved, and there was a need to bring more forward motion to the quaver detail, in order to convey the shapes of the phrases. Dynamic changes needed more even grading, though there was vivid contrast at times, and notes were pitched accurately and securely with some effective rubato at the end.  Your performance awareness and focus was clearly evident from the start, and there was a feeling of control in terms of poise and communication that supported the musical playing. For the most part, that which was presented was accurate and continuous, and there were expressive statements. Not all of these were convincing, and there was technical imbalance and unevenness in the Haydn, but some shaping, contrast and stylistic understanding was in evidence. The fact that the Haydn ended midway and, to a lesser extent, only the first of the three minatures was presented in the Sculthrope, caused imbalance in the sequence. Consistency was evident in the narrative in those portions that were presented, with some promising interpretative ideas coming across.  Thank you for sharing your performance, which was enjoyable to hear! I wish you well in your continued musical studies."
XOjOgAPk,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Allegro con brio (1st movement from Sonata in D),Joseph Haydn,Thunder in Drought Season,Chen Peixun,92,"Notes were mostly adept and there was a sustained, bright tempo in the Haydn. Characterisation was clear and positive, with a lot of focused projection and largely good control of the rhythmic intricacies. There was some unsteadiness within the coordination, mostly of semiquaver patterns, but these were generally fleeting. Dynamic changes were well directed overall; there was room for a little more breadth of dynamic range, but much shaping and purpose to support the phrasing, resulting in good sense of stylish energy and momentum.  The Chen began very robustly - more forceful than perhaps the composer intended - but with arresting and clearly conveyed articulation contrasts. As the performance unfolded there was much colour, always with focused projection of important lines and adept finger-work. Moments of light and shade were effective and the pedal supported a very assured approach to tonal balance, supported by secure and clear rhythmic playing. This was a very convincing and dramatic account.  You presented these two pieces with real conviction and played with confidence and technical dexterity, particularly in the second piece. There were aspects that needed a little more finesse and balance, and this affected the sequence just a little, but much of the communication was compelling and authoritative.  Well done! I enjoyed hearing your exceptional work, and wish you continued fulfilment in your piano studies."
XVqAjJeQ,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Ticklin Toes”,Florence Price,Prelude in C major,Johann Sebastian Bach,79,"Ticklin Toes was taken at a very brisk tempo and accurately played throughout, although the pace slowed slightly for the central section, quickening again on the return of the opening material. More could have been made of the ’accelerando’ in the final section, and there was room for stronger dynamic contrasts to give the music a wider range of colour, but this was a spirited account, full of energy and buoyancy.  The Bach Prelude flowed well from the outset, with the sustaining pedal warming the tone, although there was sometimes a little too much blurring of the texture. The tempo fluctuated a little as the piece went on, and there was some unevenness in tone, but dynamic contrasts added colour and there was a sense of the overall shape of the music. But for one melodic stumble, all was securely in place, with the final ’rit’ musically managed.  This was a committed and engaging performance of two well contrasted pieces, with the characterisation drawing on variety in articulation and dynamics. Despite tempi not always being maintained, delivery was otherwise largely controlled and there was a sense of communication throughout.  A very good performance - well done."
XewowpaX,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Ninette's Musette,George Nevada,Spiritoso,Muzio Clementi,67,"Ninette’s Musette was flexible in approach, capturing the music’s waltz-like charm with encouraging expressive ideas. Not all notes sounded clearly, with a few slips heard in the left hand’s chords, and pedal changes could have been still cleaner to avoid blurring. While room remained for a clearer pulse and rhythmic underpinning, the playing showed creativity and musicality, with rubato working well at the peaks of phrases.  The Clementi launched brightly, with variants in articulation and dynamics assisting. Semiquaver running passages often needed greater definition and evenness, with notes not always sounding. Though the left hand stopped playing for a brief time, further along in the music, the contrasting chordal sections achieved better consistency and rhythmic clarity, and during its more driven, controlled parts there were weclome signs of the music’s vibrant classical style.  The two pieces contrasted well, and in the first performance especially there was a sound grasp of the music’s limpid character. A little more stillness between items could have added to the sense of overall performance authority, and in delivery there was a call for extra consistency and precision, more so in faster passagework. In both pieces tempo selection was appropriate, with examples of a crisp attack, and a sense of occasion was communicated overall.  Well done, this was a good performance, containing moments of insight and charm. Very best wishes for your onward journey!"

Balancing parts was not always persuasive and a tendency to speed up from the middle caused unevenness. There was scope for further exploration of musical detail, but the end was carefully paced.   Daydream had a gently lilting tempo, which suited the reflective mood, and hands were confidently synchronised. The overall dynamic level was a little strong, but a sense of expressive shape became more obvious in the second half. The final phrase was conclusively controlled.  This was a determined performance and handsoften worked confidently together. Not all the refined musical detail was added - especially that of dynamics - and a tendency to rush in the first piece caused rhythmic instability. However, your obvious enjoyment and sense of accomplishment was generously shared.  Well done, this was a spirited and well coordinated performance."
XmrEdeJe,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Dance of the Wind,Timothy Brown,Sonatina in G,Ludwig van Beethoven,70,"’Dance of the Wind’ began assuredly, with convincing direction and a projected legato melody. Accompanying semiquavers were accurate, but often unrhythmic, increasingly as it progressed, with slight hesitancy where the left hand crossed over; overall pulse was just maintained, but with rather waning musical direction. Some careful dynamic shaping here, with chords neatly placed in the middle section; overall the mood was conveyed.   The Beethoven had an elegant first movement, with stylistic melodic clarity and phrasing. Chords were neatly placed, but accompanying passagework was often unrhythmic, with the pulse unsteady - hurrying towards the end; there was some dynamic shaping here. The second movement had a lyrical melody and light accompanying chords; parts were not always quite coordinated, with some unrhythmic and hesitant moments. Scope for more dynamic variety, but there was reliable continuity and some stylistic phrasing.    The performance had musical direction and engagement with different styles, with some thoughtful phrasing and dynamic shaping. Pacing between pieces was rather hurried, with moments of rhythmic unsteadiness and untidiness; but overall there was reliable fluidity here.    I particularly liked the way you conveyed the expressive mood in ’Dance of the Wind’."
XoDDzyqr,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Nocturne op.20 in C Sharp Minor,Chopin,Arabesque no.2,Debussy,85,"Appropriate textural balancing allowed the melody in the Chopin to sing, with a degree of musical sensitivty in place. Further shaping of both melody and accompaniment would have heightened expression, and there were occasional blemishes of pitching in the accompaniment along with loss of rhythmic stability in the central section, and in the combination of quavers and triplets. However, rubato was appropriately used in part, and flourshes were convincingly played.    Debussy’s Arabesque was played with suitable tonal lightness and a clear sense of playfulness. Staccato articulation was crisp and although use of an even wider dynamic range was possible, tonal contrasts were made as the piece progressed, with most of the chords secure in their pitch placement. Quieter playing sometimes saw a little tonal unevenness, although musical intention was clear throughout, and despite one or two incorrectly placed notes, this was a buoyant account.    Overall, this was a confident and musical performance. Slightly more space between items was possible to enhance poise, but musical intention was clear throughout the performance, with stylistic engagement evident in part.    Congratulations on this excellent performance. I enjoyed your ’cantabile’ melodic tone in the Chopin, and wish you the best for future musical ventures."
XyxGYJxp,13-15,Up to Grade 5,The Song of Twilight,Yoshinao Nakada,"Vivace (Third movement from Sonatina in C, Op. 36 No.1",Muzio Clementi,67,"The Clementi flowed reliably at the start, with some stylistic articulation. Hands were coordinated at first, with mainly rhythmic semiquaver passages - though less secure as it progressed, with slips and untidiness often rather disruptive. There was some dynamic variety, but the tone became slightly forced in louder playing; overall there was continuity here.  The opening of the Nakada was unclear, but this soon settled with reliable accuracy and balanced parts. Chords were neatly placed, with rhythmic melodic semiquavers; there were a few untidy and unsteady moments, but this had some dynamic shaping, and continuity overall.  This was a fluent and generally accurate performance. Different musical styles were conveyed, with some dynamic shaping - though the tone became rather heavy in louder playing, with untidy moments along the way. Performance poise was not always maintained, but this concluded successfully.  I liked the way you projected the melodic line clearly in the Nakada."
YDDQEnXy,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Etude No. 2 in C major, Op. 299",Carl Czerny,"Invention in B-flat Major, BWV 785",J. S. Bach,75,"The fingerwork was suitably agile and lively at the start of the Czerny study, and the account had a sense of flow. The hands were balanced and coordinated and the interplay between the hands was negotiated neatly. The chords were placed together and the technical delivery was reliable. Rather more lift and buoyancy would have been welcome, as well as some grading in the dynamics, but the line was maintained and the piece showed some technical facility.  The rhythmic patterns were precise and defined at the start of the Bach Invention. The fingerwork was suitably light and delicate and the quicker passages were largely even and controlled. Much more detailing and shaping could have been explored but the pulse was settled and the account was fluent.  Both of the chosen pieces showed finger dexterity but something with a more contrasting style, or lyricism, would have been welcome to demonstrate musicianship. There was a sense of reserve in the presentation and rather energy and lift could have been found. However, the technical delivery was secure and reliable in this very good presentation."
YDZVKdAq,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Allegro, 1st movement from Sonatina in C,Op 20, No.1",Fedrich kuhlau,Ivan is Very Busy,Aram Khachaturian,89,"The Allegro saw tonal brightness in the melody, phrase shaping supporting the melodic outline well, and with dynamic contrasts suitably wide.  Throughout, accompanying figures were subtly played, and although there was scope for just a little more drive forwards and vivacity, with occasional blemishes of rhythmic precision and pitch centring, more so in the central section, this was a technically secure account.  The character of 'Ivan is very busy' was found from the outset, supported by crisp staccato articulation and strong use of marcato.  Throughout, the phrases were shaped with appropriate tonal graduation, highlighting their direction, and although there were a few blemishes of evenness apparent in the quieter playing and as patterns changed, the sense of constant movement was never compromised, the second half becoming more confident in its technical prowess.  A poised and convincing performance overall in which you played with consistent focus and stylistic integrity.  The time taken between items was well judged, and focus was evident throughout, musical characterisation very well managed and conveyed, and with increasing musical confidence apparent.  Congratulations on this excellent performance.  I particularly enjoyed the musical characterisation in your second piece, and wish you all the best in your future musical ventures."
ZKvzdogJ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Allegro 1st movement from sonatina in C op.20 no.1,Friedrich kuhlau,Love theme,Catherine Rollin,65,"A suitably flowing pace was adopted initially in the Kuhlau. There were quite a few note deviations along the way and the running passagework tended to suffer from unevenness, with the hands coming adrift at times. The dabs of pedal were effectively added and some of the drama was caught in the minor key episodes although a more stable pulse was needed in general. A lighter accompanying part, together with some more graceful shaping within the melodic lines would have enhanced the interpretation, but you caught the energy of the movement successfully overall.  In your ’Love Theme’ there was a thoughtful and graceful lilt to the phrases and you encapsulated the wistful mood to good effect. The use of pedal brought some warmth to the tone colour although bass notes were not always ’caught’ in the pedal. The changes of tempo were well gauged, with apt intensity as the momentum increased, though the melodic line needed to soar more plaintively through the textures in general. Nevertheless it was a sensitive and sincere interpretation.  The programme was presented confidently on the whole although there was a need for more time and space in between items so as to allow the musical effect to settle. The technical element of the work showed good overall continuity although quite a number of slips and rhythmical disturbances occurred in the Kuhlau. The contrasting styles were well realised on the whole, with some thoughtful playing in the ’Love Theme’ in particular, although more definition of melodic lines was needed, alongside further phrasing detail in the more Classical work. Overall, however, there was a good sense of commitment in your performance.  I especially enjoyed your interpretation of the Catherine Rollin piece today. Well done and best wishes for all your future piano playing!"
ZORLYBjj,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Sonatina Op. 36 No. 1,Muzio Clementi,By the Seaside Op. 63,Louis Streabbog,79,"The Sonatina was taken at a lively tempo and musically presented from the outset, with bold contrasts in dynamics and articulation and a sense of shape in the phrasing. There was room to lighten the LH accompaniment in places and some of the gradual dynamic changes could have been more carefully graded, but apart from occasional unevenness in tone and flow, this was a characterful and spirited account.  By the Seaside began sensitively and flowed well, with the sustaining pedal warming the tone.  Sometimes pedal changes were a little delayed, slightly blurring the texture, and there was a little tonal unevenness in places, but this was a secure and musical account, with the middle section effectively contrasted and tempo changes well managed.  This was an engaging and committed performance, strongly communicated throughout. The two pieces were very effectively contrasted in style, drawing on a wealth of contrasts in dynamics and articulation, as well as expressive shaping. But for a little tonal unevenness, and scope for more careful management of textures, delivery was controlled throughout.  Congratulations on this very good performance."
ZYbWmGkk,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Waltz in B minor,Franz Schubert,Jackson Street Blues,Martha Mier,89,"You controlled the textures adeptly in the Schubert Waltz, allowing the melody to pervade clearly, supported by mostly even tone in the accompaniment. There was scope for the right-hand lines to be just a little brighter in outlook, but the pedal was tidy, ensuring clear and warm sound. The hands moved adeptly to sustain even accompanying rhythms and tidy dotted patterns. Expressive ideas were well conveyed, with a little subtlety in the tempo as well - there was room for even more overt contrasting statements, but dynamic shaping was true to the style.  ”Jackson Street Blues” was presented as a suitably ’lazy’, relaxed blues tune, swung effectively and with evident understanding of the style. There were a few note misplacements, slightly altering the harmonic detail, and room for more consistent coordination and voicing in managing the often quite busy textures. The playing was clear, well sustained and neatly shaped, though - sometimes slightly reserved in general projection of contrasts, but always with integrity to the character.  This was a well paced and excellently controlled performance of two very different pieces. Both were lyrical in their own ways, and you successfully emphasised this expressive lyricism whilst remaining stylistically well founded in your delivery. Any blemishes or moments of slight caution did not affect the ebb and flow of the playing.  Congratulations on this excellent performance, and all the best for your continued musical studies!"
ZrwqwLVD,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Minuet in G,Anon,The Song of Twilight,Yoshinao Nakada,88,"The first piece began with smooth lines, which were balanced and bright in tone. Effective and appropriate articulation was consistently applied, and the hands were largely well coordinated. There was scope for the dynamic involvement to be even more vibrant. Phrases moved with a suitable and engaging lilt, as lines were contoured and the notes were secure in relation to pitch throughout.    A calm and atmospheric opening was clear from the start of The Song of Twilight. The pedal was well controlled for the most part, with only some blurring of the parts within the middle section. Phrases moved with a positive sense of direction, and whilst there was scope to explore a wider range of tonal sonorities, the lyrical nature of the piece was embodied.    There was a clear sense of poise and control when playing, with textures confidently balanced throughout. The pieces contrasted well and there was an organised pacing between the items too. The different musical identities of the pieces come across mostly effectively, conveying a strong sense of stylistic awareness, just leaving room for more persuasive and expressive portrayal. The technical demands of the programme were met with positivity.    This was a very well controlled and assured performance. Thank you for playing."
aAJQAlZg,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Ninette's Musette,George Nevada,La Nouvelle Poupee,P.I.Tchaikovsky,73,"Ninette’s Musette was lilting in tempo, and the gentle character of this dance was conveyed. Pedalling lacked control and tended to abruptly shorten lower left hand notes, which impacted the stamina of phrasing. There was room for further dynamic colour and for a more obvious sense of direction in the phrasing, but hands worked comfortably together.   La Nouvelle Poupee was immediately energised and patterns of articulation were quickly established. Coordinating left hand accompanying figures became gradually less resilient and little of the refined musical detail was consistently added. However, moments of instability were well negotiated and the end was conclusive.  This was a purposeful performance, with a feeling of space between pieces. Tempo choices were well made and the different musical styles were understood, though not always colourfully delivered. There were technical challenges of pedalling in Ninette’s Musette and synchronisation in the second piece, and room for a much wider range of dynamic colour overall. However, you played with plenty of energy and enjoyment, and challenges were resolved.  Well done. This was a committed performance."
aEvJoolk,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Sonata in D,Domenico Scarlatti,"Snow, Moon and Flowers",Peter Sculthorpe,82,"The performance began with a spirited account of the Scarlatti, with much bright projection and bold emphasis supporting a lively tempo choice. The pulse was well sustained and there was a wide dynamic range, revealing engagement with the style and the need to contrast phrases. There was unevenness in the projection and the rhythmic management, resulting in occasional note misplacements and loss of clarity or precision, but the ornamentation was stylish and there was always focused and positive energy in the playing. Some of the shaping needed more integrity and consistency, with a tendency for melodic lines to lose tonal balance, but there was much colour in the playing, nonetheless.  The Sculthorpe began with suitably hushed ambience and muted colours, supported by the pedal which ensured controlled but resonant textures. Tempo choices were on the quick side, and there was scope for more space and variety in the pacing, which was somewhat urgent in ’Moon’ especially, restricting the scope for greater colour and contrast. Notes were in place, despite misjudgements in rhythmic or pulse management, and a very wide dynamic range ensured conviction in the story telling.  Your performance was boldly presented, with often secure technical work and plenty of contrast. There was scope for it to be more controlled in terms of pace and colour, with not all of the stylistic choices fully convincing in realisation, and a feel of general urgency affecting the evocative nature of the Scuthorpe in particular. You played with a sense of authority, though, and there was much diversity in terms of expressive breadth and tonal colour, which was engaging.  Thank you for sharing your playing, and congratulations on achieving an excellent overall performance. I wish you continued success and fulfilment in your piano studies!"
aMVJMWWb,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Allegro moderato,Joseph Haydn,New Kid,Christopher Norton,86,"The Haydn performance contained much wit and stylistic detail - a well gauged speed and touch added to its sense of engagement and control. Accurately presented, with mostly even semiquaver scalic passages and nimble ornaments. There was room for the development section to explore greater enterprise in dynamics and other effects, though much was accurate and well detailed, bringing the classical style vividly to life.  New Kid was characterfully done and benefited from a clear attack, as well as areas of added pizzazz. An occasional less rhythmically rooted patch and moment of unease in hand coordination occurred, with a call for extra overall exuberence, for example during the later, more improvisatory music. The overall choice of pace was good, and the best areas of the performance connected well with the music's flamboyant, jazzy style.  In each of the pieces there was a clear sense of purpose and stylistic grasp. Much was accurate and creative, notwithstanding isolated patches of less dependable facility and accuracy, and the two pieces contrasted well also. Examples of insight and ingenuity were good to hear, especially during the Haydn.  Many congratulations, and very best wishes for your onward musical journey!"
aOzPnxOe,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude And Fugue In B Flat Major, BWV 866",J.S. Bach,"Arabesque No. 2: From Deux Arabesques, L.66",Claude Debussy,95,"Bach’s Prelude was played with tonal brightness and fluency, the phrases musically shaped with tonal graduation to give direction to the line. Occasional blemishes of evenness affected articulation of the semiquavers, although accuracy was maintained, and the second half saw appropriate flexibility of tempo. The fugal subject was musically shaped with variation of articulation and tonal phrasing, and throughout the movement, subject definition was controlled, giving textural clarity to the counterpoint, despite occasional slips of evenness as the texture thickened and hands were coordinated. A convincing account overall.  A real sense of playfulness supported the character of the Arabesque from the outset, tone light and with precision of articulation and fingerwork giving an air of confidence to the flamboyant style. Sometimes, the quieter dynamic level needed just a little more exploration, although musical shaping was appropriate throughout, contrasts of articulation clearly defined, and with accuracy consistent for the majority of this assured rendition.  Throughout the performance, you played with technical assurance and musical conviction, the contrasting styles clearly defined and musically communicated to your audience. Personal involvement was consistent and the styliistic engagement of your playing was persuasve, making it a pleasure to watch.  Many congratulations on this exceptional performance and I wish you every success in your further musical ventures."
aRyxMGmJ,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Mouvement de valse,Louise Farrenc,Idylle,Cecile Chaminade,76,"A bright tone and sprightly tempo were in place for Mouvement de valse. The tone colours and mood of each section might have been more contrasted to support style and character, but the pulse was firm and the notes flowed robustly.  There was a legato flow in the main in Idylle and some effective pedalling. Further flexibility in tempo and rise and fall in the shaping would have supported the phrasing more stylishly, but the notes flowed with confidence.  There was a clear sense of focus and conviction in this performance, although more musical shaping supported by contrast in tone and dynamic would have enhanced the sense of style and character in the chosen pieces.  Well done on a securely memorised performance."
aVYdQlxV,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Velocity, Op. 109 No. 10",J. F. F. Burgmüller,Galop Final,Casella,90,"The Burgmuller was crisply articulated and phrases were directed with a sense of poise at a suitably energetic tempo. There was the occasional note blemish, with a little loss of tonal clarity in the running figures and room for further nuancing in terms of phrasing detail but it was nevertheless projected with agility and authority.  The cheeky character was convincingly portrayed, with nimble and incisive staccato work being featured,. There was room for a little additional tonal variation but the changes of tempo latterly were nonchalantly handled and the humour of the writing was engagingly caught.  The programme was presented with a sense of authority and professionalism, appropriate space being allowed in between items. The technical demands of the work were readily met throughout, with a strong degree of rhythmic fluency and largely secure note accuracy. Tidy hand synchronisation was nearly always maintained, without the need for any compromise of tempo. The musical styles on offer were similarly well realised, with a broad and emphatic dynamic range. There was scope for additional finesse and variation but the playing as a whole was communicated with sparkle and vivacity.  Congratulations on this most persuasive performance!"
aVlGbqxz,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude in C sharp minor: No. 10 from 24 Preludes, Op. 81",Stephen Heller,Honey (Humoresque): third movement from In The Bottoms,R. N. Dett,68,"There was tenderness in the projection of the Heller, particularly helpful in balancing the sound between the hands so that melodic lines came across clearly. The shaping of phrases was often clear, and revealed some awareness of the ebbing and flowing nature of the music, though there was scope to use the pedal more liberally to support this with more resonant and colourful sound. The tempo choice was cautious, given the composer’s marking, and this significantly slower approach impacted on the general character and direction of the phrasing, with some unease in the closing stages briefly affecting the momentum, though this was quickly recovered. There needed to be more urgency in the playing to counterbalance the lightness and delicacy that you did achieve, though expressive statements often convinced, such as the delivery of the final chords.  ’Honey’ was generally accurately presented, in terms of its rhythmic and harmonic detail, and where the playing flowed more positively there was characterisation and contrast. The tempo was significantly slower than the mark in the outer sections, though more suited to the central part; changes in tempo lacked secure conviction and there were other missed opportunities to convey the composer’s stylistic and expressive intentions, with mostly careful delivery of the technical detail leaving other musical aspects less overtly explored. Some of the middle and final section was uneasy in flow and facility, but contrasts were still very much in evidence and the ending had a sense of flair.  Though you presented these two lyrical pieces with an emphasis on their lyricism rather than their momentum, this did make for some expressive and sometimes colourful playing, and notes and rhythms were generally accurate. A sense of engagement with the musical narrative was sensed, and the performance communicated some distinct personal musical choices, even if some of these were less in alignment with the musical demands of the music. Overall, the playing involved the listener well and conveyed plenty of colour and contrast.  Thank you for sharing your performance, and well done. It was enjoyable, and I wish you many more enjoyable and fulfilling musical experiences in the future."
aWOyMVMM,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Carnival in Rio,William Gillock,Presto: 3rd movement from Sonata no. 6 in C minor,Giovanni Battista Pescetti,78,"The Carnival in Rio bounced forwards securely with cleanly articulated fingerwork. The chords could have been bolder in projection and a bigger dynamic arc developed. There was real attention to the phrasing detail though, whilst the samba rhythm had strong definition.  A lively speed characterised the Presto with an ease of flow ever present, although slightly rushing in the central part. There was room to make the tonal contrasts wider and detached left hand notes became clipped at times. However passagework had real clarity and projection.   The performance was confidently presented and there was a very good feel for the character of each piece, if scope for more nuance.  I enjoyed the committed approach, well done."
abQwbqdr,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Spiritoso,Muzio Clementi,The village in May,Joe Hisaishi,85,"A bright tone and lightness in the articulations suited the Spiritoso and the dynamics were effectively terraced, with phrases clearly pointed and shaped. There were brief moments of rhythmic uneveness along the way in the RH, but much was neat and confidently stylish in the playing.  The sprightly tempo captured the jaunty spirit of The Village in May, with a good grasp of the rhythmic shape present and buoyancy in the articulations. There was scope for more vibrant dynamic contrast and detail but this was an engaging performance.  A confident performance with a poise in the pacing and clear contrasting of the musical character and style of the chosen pieces.  I particularly enjoyed the sense of the narrative which came across in your performance of The Village in May Joey."
aexxEDQR,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Venetianisches Gondellied,Felix Mendelssohn,Polonaise in A.,F. Chopin,65,"In the Mendelssohn the phrases were sensitively shaped and the dark mood was conveyed with intensity. There were various misdirected notes but the melodic line was carefully delineated. The use of pedal added tonal sonority although smudges of harmony were encountered at times in the process. Despite a few more note slips as it progressed the rubato was expressively integrated.  In the Polonaise you caught much of the flamboyance of the writing, with a clear sense of rhythmical impetus in your bold tone and purposefully-clipped dotted rhythms. There were quite a number of errors and ’splashes’ in the chordal work in particular and the playing needed greater precision in general but the forthright accenting and well-committed dynamic colours lent character to your playing.   The programme was presented with an air of calm professionalism and you allowed appropriate time and space in between items. Overall there was a need for further accuracy in the note placements, mainly in the Chopin, but you performed with a welcome sense of stylistic awareness and commitment.  There was much musicality to enjoy in your playing and I wish you all the best as you continue to progress."
ajVAXwQO,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Over the Bars,James Price Johnson,Juin: Barcarolle,P.I.Tchaikovsky,78,"A positive, appropriate tempo was set at the start, and the style of the music came across well in the introduction and in the opening phrases of the first section. Here, notes and rhythms were well controlled and accurate, though hints of hurrying were evident. As the piece progressed, there were losses of firm pulse and imprecisions in the notes. This particularly affected the left hand, and the playing felt somewhat frenetic as a result, with a need for more consistent control and broader dynamic statements. Continuity was sustained, though, and there was plenty of energy and boldness at the end.  The Tchaikovsky began sedately and there was engagement with the lyrical nature of the music, with some insightful rubato helping to shape phrases. There was scope for more balance, with a tendency for accompanying detail to dominate and pedal to blur the texture. This became more noticeable in the middle section, and there were note misplacements here which diminished the effect of the build to the central climax. Thematic interplay in the final section was effective, catching the reflective character with accurate notes in place.  The performance overall was always focused and the vivid contrast of style between the two pieces was successfully conveyed. The playing needed more consistent control and technical precision, to support the musical and well-founded interpretative ideas. Nevertheless, much of the playing was expressive and individual.  I enjoyed hearing you play - thank you for sharing your work, and all best wishes for continued enjoyment and success in your piano studies."
aonWnDPe,10-12,Up to Grade 5,March in D,C.P.E.Bach,Austrian Dance,Burgmüller,78,"C. P. E. Bach’s March in D was played with a positive feeling of rhythmic lift, and the figures were placed with a reliable sense of control with just a small slip occurring right at the end. There was nonetheless room for more spirited articulation and greater tonal confidence in the melodic line, but the flow was commendably secure and something of the music’s march-like character was projected.  In the Austrian Dance by Burgmüller the articulation was clear and crisp, and moments of dynamic nuance added to the energy and vitality of your playing. Tempo consistency wasn’t always fully reliable, with some unevenness in the flow occurring along the way, but a feeling for the dance quality of the music was conveyed - even if more flexibility of contour was possible - and note accuracy was largely assured.  This was a focused performance, with a keen sense of involvement present throughout, and there was much to commend in the technical delivery despite some rhythmical irregularities along the way. More expressive insight was possible, and the phrasing sometimes required more varied shaping, but a good feeling of poise was always conveyed throughout the performance.  Well done on this sensitively presented playing!"
araXWMwG,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Csikós Post,Hermann Necke,Arabesque No 1,Claude Debussy,85,"Crisp staccato playing was a laudable feature in ’Csikos Post’, with a suitably light touch giving particulary apt colour. Semiquavers in the right hand of the main theme were less tidily managed, with scope also for a little more sustenence in the final chords to really add panache to the ending. Otherwise it was colourful, shapely and stylish playing.  There was a definite sense of expression achieved in the Debussy, a broad range of colour and a clear melodic line were both admirable features. That said, the touch was quite firm in the loudest moments, sometimes impacting the sense of tonal warmth in the right hand and in some of the chords. More nuanced contours and further rhythmic poise in the first half would have given it a more vivid effect, but it was fluent, assured and insightful playing nevertheless.  An engaging performance, with a clear feeling of personal invovlment, but also projection, achieved throughout. Various stylistic nuances could have been further refined, more particularly in the Debussy where the shaping was generally in need of a more seamless effect. Regardless, a solid understanding of the two different styles was clear, and the technical demands were managed with apparent ease.  Excellent playing! I especailly admire the lightness of your touch in the Necke, and of your mature grasp of the concepts of balance and rhythmic flexibility through the Debussy. I hope you enjoy many future performances!"
bRogakON,7-9,Up to Grade 5,"Invention in D minor, BWV 775",Johann Sebastian Bach,Dolly’s dreaming and awakening,Theodore Oesten,70,"The Bach Invention was taken at an apt tempo and accurately played in the main, with some colourful variety in the articulation, and the important melodic material effectively projected from the texture overall. Not quite all the shorter notes flowed evenly and some of the ornamental detail could have been a little tidier, but there was something of the style captured.  The narrative of Dolly’s Dreaming and Awakening was brought to life through the various contrasting moods, which were vividly projected, with some musically shaped phrasing in the opening section, and characterful contrasts in dynamics and articulation as the piece went on. There were a few melodic stumbles and the hands sometimes needed to be more precisely coordinated but this was colourful playing.  Engagement and poise were maintained throughout the performance of these two effectively contrasted pieces. There was room for greater control in some of the delivery, but characterisation was especially effective in the second half of the performance.  A very good performance - well done."
bVoWyqPg,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"J.S Bach Invention in D minor, BWV 775",J.S Bach,Adagietto Pianissimo by Ginastera,Alberto Ginastera,79,"The Bach was confidently attacked at a bright speed. The counterpoint was often well-defined and the phrases had clear direction here. Some slight untidiness appeared during the long trill passages and there was scope to find further differentiation of articulation throughout, but it was still a convincing account.  A calm atmosphere was created in the Adagietto with an appropriately soft tonal palette. A little more rhythmic pointing could have been in place and there was room to be bolder with the phrase shaping. However an easy lilt was maintained and the sound was always well-judged.  This was presented with a calm authority and I enjoyed the different characters of each piece. A shade more outward communication could have been found overall.  Bravo on some very good playing throughout this performance."
bXGznzWr,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Invention No. 8 in F Major, BWV 779",Johann Sebastian Bach,"Nocturne in C-sharp Minor, Op. Posth., B. 49",Frédéric Chopin,79,"Bach’s ’Invention’ was well paced, an apt sense of character was achieved in this regard. It tended to slow slightly in parts where both hands played broken chords. more variety of shape and a more sensitive balance beween the hands would have given it a more expressive effect, but it was melodically assured and entirely fluent.  Chopin’s ’Nocturne’ found some suitably sombre colours, and the legato was often effectively controlled. Rhythmically it was a little slow and needed a more rubato approach to bring out the style convincingly, with the left hand also tending to be the more prominent voice in the balance, especially where the melody was quietest. Still the ornaments and right hand flourishes were well executed, and all of the notes were found with assured fluency.  A totally committed performance, there was a sense of surety in your approach across the programme. The expressive elements of both works needed further development, mostly in terms of balancing and shaping, but also with regard to rhythmic freedom in the Chopin. Nevertheless, a solid technique meant their delivery was still very convincing as a whole.  Bravo! A very good performance which showcased your various musical strengths. I sincerely hope you continue to share these achievements with others in furture performances, and wish you all the best as you progress on your musical journey!"
bXgaxKVj,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Thunder in drought season,Chen Pei Xun,Danny Boy,Niiki Illes,88,"The changing moods of the Chen were colourfully characterised, and largely secure notes and rhythms supported this. Articulation was often well focused and there was plenty of positive and often energetic phrase direction. The playing was sometimes compromised by coordination and projection unease, and there was scope for more consistently tidy note placement and rhythmic delivery, particularly in some of the more intricate decorative passages. A wide dynamic range brought much effective and impactful expression, and though tempo changes were sometimes overdone, the playing had authenticity in terms of its ebb and flow.  You presented the opening phrases of ”Danny Boy” with lyrical shape and expressive insight. Melodic lines were strongly projected and the harmonic underlay did not intrude, though it was sufficiently voiced for the colour from the jazzy chord shapes to always be present. There was a little untidy placement along the way, and in the middle, around the key transition, the momentum was less clear. There were scope for even more sensitivity at the quietest moments, and broader sweeps to accentuate the song-like qualities, especially around the final climax. Rhythmic detail was articulated with insight, though, and the ending was poignantly done.  Throughout the performance you demonstrated strong awareness of style and the importance of communicating the characters and moods of the two pieces. The playing was well paced and the colours and contrasts were well conveyed. Technical delivery was secure, but just a little inconsistent at times, in terms of balance and tonal clarity, more tellingly in the first piece. The rendition of ”Danny Boy” was expressively compelling and touching.  Thank you for sharing your playing! There was much excellent work, and lots of musical insight. I wish you continued success in your music."

Bach,"Polonaise no. 11 in G minor, Op.posth KKIIa Nr.1",Frederic Chopin,87,"Articulation achieved variety in the Bach Invention, with vitality communicated, and the style was realised. Effective dialogue between the hands was displayed, though even more detail and shape were possible in the left hand figures. Although some slightly untidy co-ordination was audible, the interpretation was stylish, with the ending poised.   The Polonaise captured a wide range of dynamics, with the elegance of this composer present. Despite this, there was room for even bolder shaping of some phrases, together with further colour and a little more expression in the accompaniment. A well judged balance between the hands was preserved, nonetheless, and the right hand possessed a bright tone, with an appropriate elasticity explored.   Considerable finesse was conveyed in these interpretations, though even more variety in mood was possible between the two chosen pieces. A little more control was required in a few places, as well as further expression in the left hand at times, but stylistic demands were well met. The tone retained clarity, with sensitivity apparent, and some effective voicing was achieved.   An excellent performance, with an extensive range of delicate colours employed, and the rhythms were able to dance. Congratulations!"
blYaZAgM,10-12,Grade 5 and above,15 Inventions a 3 Voix,Johann Sebastian Bach,Rhapsodie,Maxwell Eckstein,88,"Bach’s Invention was immediately playful in character, with a firm feeling of dialogue between hands. Balancing and highlighting entries was not always wholly assured, and held notes lacked sufficient tonal weight overall. However, there was plenty of expressive shape and an especially well paced closing passage.   Rhapsodie began with exuberance and with colourful dynamics. The style was clearly enjoyed, and changes of tempo and character were carefully managed. Small smudges in chords impacted bigger moments and there was room for an even wider range of dynamic variety, to more fully capture the excitement. However, this was a confident and effectively communicated performance.  You played with determination, clearly understanding the stylistic demands of each piece. Pacing was not wholly convincing though, with limited time before the Rhapsodie, and a spoken introduction was omitted. Nevertheless, musical ideas were obvious and were openly shared.  Congratulations. This was a colourful and determined performance."
bmeZkqvv,10-12,Grade 5 and above,New Kid,Christopher Norton,iL Pleut,Mélanie Bonis,86,"’New Kid’ had bright energy and melodic clarity, with the mood instantly captured. Chords were crisp and neatly placed, with parts mostly coordinated - though not consistently. Strong pulse and rhythmic assurance throughout, but occasional melodic figures were rushed, with briefly waning musical focus in the middle section - though accuracy and clarity were maintained in quick passages. The tone was often slightly forced, with scope for wider tonal and dynamic variety across the piece, particularly quieter moments - but this was stylistically confident.    ’Il Pleut’ began with assured direction and rhythmic semiquavers passed neatly between hands. The melody was mostly clearly projected, with crisp staccato - though occasionally the tone became slightly over-bright; there were a few untidy and unrhythmic moments, with isolated unprojected notes and fleeting instability unsettling melodic lines. Effective musical flexibility and transitions between sections; room for quieter, warmer tone in places, and for more lightness in touch overall - but there was careful dynamic shaping and bold focus here.    This was a secure and carefully paced performance, with confident momentum, and stylistic communication and engagement throughout; room for wider tonal range overall, but this was an assured and committed presentation.    I particularly admired the crisp rhythmic definition you maintained through extended semiquaver passages in ’Il Pleut’."
bpjalxzZ,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Spanish Guitar,William Gillock,Spinning Song,Albert Ellmenreich,76,"The Spanish Guitar was fluently presented with rhythmic energy and neat fingerwork. Repeated notes were sometimes over-projected and slowed the lines, but there was much effective variety and character here.  The Spinning Song was confidently played at a bright pace. A lighter touch could have been cultivated for the detached notes and accents were often a little heavy in attack. Dynamics were beautifully graded though and musical direction was always in evidence.  The performance could have been enhanced by a more fluid presentation and holding the mood of each piece to the end of the final note. However the character of each piece was well-conveyed.  I enjoyed the differing moods here. Well done on achieving some very good playing."
bqrkLARK,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Skyfall,Adele,Vivace,Muzio Clementi,75,"Skyfall began with a carefully paced first chord, which provided an unhurried opening to this performance. The tempo was well judged and usually maintained, though faster notes sometimes caused instability. Pedalling lacked a really unified approach and there was room for further consideration of balance, to allow the melody to sing freely above accompanying chords. However, the reflective character was conveyed.   Clementi’s Vivace danced with energy, at a lively tempo. There were moments of unevenness and a slight tendency to rush through bars of quavers. However, some of the refined detail was added and hands worked efficiently together much of the time.  This was a carefully paced performance, with space for reflection between each piece, and the contrasting styles were clearly understood. Pedalling and clarity of finer detail lacked consistency, but your enjoyment was obvious.  This was a determined and cheerful performance, well done."
dABdwvXA,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Regret,Levi Gunardi,Arabesque No.1,Debussy,87,"You began ’Regret’ with appropriate poise, a warm tone being projected. The melodic line was carefully highlighted and you shaped the lines thoughtfully, although there was room for further use of varied tonal shading and for some evocative moments of more tender dynamic. The flowing passages were rhythmically secure, with just the odd misdirected note or hint of smudged harmony. The intensity of the piece was, however, well understood.  The Debussy flowed confidently and freely for the most part. The melodic material could have projected more sonorously through some gentler accompanying textures and at times there was a need for more refinement of pedaling to avoid overly-clouded harmonies. The marked changes in dynamic and tempo were faithfully followed although further expressive and interpretative detail could have been explored, with more spaciousness in the phrasing to highlight the more magical and ethereal moments of Debussy’s writing. It was, nonetheless, a rhythmically secure and gracefully shaped account  The programme was presented in a calm and professional manner, with appropriate space being afforded in between items. The technical aspect of the work showed good overall security and fluency, with the rhythmical features being confidently negotiated, barring occasional minor blemishes. The contrasting styles were well defined and whilst there was room for more depth of expression, with further exploration of the imagery behind the writing in your use of tonal shading, you nevertheless showed a convincing understanding of the musical structures of the two works in this well-committed performance.  There was much to enjoy in your excellent playing - well done and good luck in all your future musical exploits!"
dBoOQwnY,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Spooky Wood Hollow,Heather Hammond,Sleeping Beauty,Ivana Loudova,77,"The opening of Spooky Wood Hollow was crisply articulated and the playing was characterised by bold and colourful contrasts in dynamics and articulation, which brought the music to life. Not quite all was rhythmically precise, slightly impeding the flow in places, but notes were all in place in this engaging performance.  Sleeping Beauty was taken at a lively pace and accurately played throughout, although there was occasional slight unevenness of flow and tone, particularly in some of the shorter notes. The changes in mood were characterised through a wide range of dynamics and articulation and there was just room to make more of the dance character. A colourful account with tempo changes effectively managed.  There was a strong sense of performance, demonstrating engagement and commitment throughout. There was a little unevenness in the delivery at times, but the two contrasting pieces were boldly characterised, bringinthe music to life.  Contratulations on this very good performace."
dDXpnbKB,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Allegretto,Bohuslav Martinu,Mazurka in A Minor,Fryderyk Chopin,77,"The Martinu was played with a bold attack and clear observation of the accents. The tempo was a little cautious to fully capture the energy of the piece, with phrases not quite achieving elegance of shape. However, throughout the account the rhythmic shapes had real clarity and dynamics were often effectively placed too.  A thoughtful tempo allowed the Chopin to unfold with space. There was much expressive shaping of the melodic line and the left hand was carefully balanced. The texture was not always clearly voiced in the major section and the momentum was quite static here. A very assured use of the pedal was evident though and I enjoyed the poised end to the mazurka.  The pieces were positively presented with good contrasts of character. A little more overall flow and confidence could have been in place to fully achieve the spirit of the music.  I appreciated the attention to detail throughout and the calm approach. Well done on some very good playing."
dVvGLwAZ,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Wallace and Gromit Theme,Julian Nott,Waltz Op. 12 No. 2,Edvard Grieg,91,"Energetic flow and impetus were immediately apparent in the Wallace and Gromit theme and you brought rhythmic vitality to the figures. Highlighting the quirky nature of the accompaniment was particularly effective, and you brought real flair to the conclusion. This was a compelling account and the way you brought out a sense of the music’s jocular character was engaging.  The Grieg Waltz was played with apt rhythmic lift and there was robust control in the flow and direction. There was nonetheless room for more flexibility in shaping the lines, and there were moments earlier on when keener balance was possible, though the middle of the piece brought more expressive insight, warmly conveying the character of the music, though with just scope for greater tonal consistency along the way.  Clear musicality informed both interpretations, and particularly the first piece was played with decisive intuition. The direct way in which you performed also helped to enhance the character of the music, with an eager sense of involvement ever-present.  Congratulations on such polished playing – and I particularly enjoyed your sense of fun in Wallace and Gromit!"
dVzbZZgV,7-9,Up to Grade 5,The quiet wood,Michael Head,Allegretto in C,Anton Diabelli,75,"Lines were smooth and clean in The Quiet Wood, and phrases were fluent too. There was some organised dynamic involvement, particularly in the latter half of the piece, though scope to explore the lyrical and expressive components more vividly. Notes were accurate in relation to pitch.   Allegretto in C began with strong, determined chords and the hands were largely well coordinated throughout. Momentum was always maintained, though the pulse slowed somewhat, leaving room for more rhythmic security and fluency. Although there was room to communicate the style more persuasively, the tone remained confident.   A sense of involvement was conveyed, as lines were confidently projected and textures controlled. There was some organised pacing between the two pieces, which were contrasting. The different musical identities of the pieces came across in part, conveying an appropriate mood, but leaving room for more detailed and expressive portrayal overall. There needed to be more control over pulse, but a sense of momentum was always present.  Thank you for playing - I enjoyed the dynamic shaping as The Quiet Wood progressed. It was more communicative and involved."
dYxJkYRW,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Rondo Alla Turca,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,Summer,Joe Hisaishi,77,"The Mozart was presented with suitably bright, positive character and there was much emphasis to direct the phrases with purpose. Articulation was often focused and tidy, ensuring clear lines and well projected melodic parts. There was some inconsistency in note coordination, which affected the rhythmic evenness, more tellingly in the coda, where right-hand chord precision was less secure. There were also several tempo changes which were less stylistically well founded, tending to rob the music of its momentum. Dynamic changes were often vivid, though, and this brought effective light and shade to the playing.  The Hisaishi was presented boldly and with clear awareness of colour. This was conveyed often through articulation and dynamic contrasts, though with some inconsistency in focusing staccato playing and grading the crescendos and diminunedos to afford clear and convincing shape to the long phrases. There were moments of less assured rhythmic control, with the minimalist-style sections needing greater precision and focus, but you always presented the music with authenticity and conviction, and with largely accurate technical detail.  As a performance, this was well paced and characterised, with the distinct difference in styles well communicated. The playing was technically mostly secure and there was a lot of clear projection, allowing melodies to pervade with brightness and for rhythmical shapes and characters to be well directed. There was room for more precision and tonal control, and in the Mozart some of the interpretative choices were less convincing, but as a whole there was a sense of flow and of focus as you presented the music.  Thank you for sharing your playing - it was enjoyable to hear! Best wishes for continued success and enjoyment in your piano studies."
dezEwVPR,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Tempo di Minuetto,Marianne von Martinez,il Porco rosso,Joe Hisaishi,79,"The Tempo di Minuetto saw tonal brightness and musical contouring of the melodic line from the outset.  There were moments when slips of pitch centring occurred, and some phrases saw slight inconsistency in pulse steadiness.  However, ornaments were confidently executed, and this was an account full of musical outline.  The contrasting styles of the Hisaishi were musically conveyed, melodic projection and suitable phrase shaping evident throughout.  Although the use of rubato was appropriate, too much flexibility did detract from rhythmic distinction in the introduction, and the 'tempo giusto' took time to settle into a steady pulse.  However, although some chordal delivery was not entirely secure in its pitching, a good degree of accuracy was maintained, with many of the musical details noted.  You played with clear musical conviction throughout this performance, stylistic engagement consistently evident, and despite the occasional slips of technical control and accuracy, you maintained composure and poise, the contrasting styles clearly defined.  Congratulaitions on this very good performance.  I particularly enjoyed the melodic contouring you conveyed in the use of tonal graduation."
dkNMgOaq,13-15,Grade 5 and above,MOONSCAPE,EDWIN ROXBURGH,SELLING SUNDRY GOODS,PEIXUN CHEN,85,"Moonscape conveyed a good sense of purpose and captured the austere soundworld well overall. Further subtleties of touch and tone were needed, to even more fully target its mysterious, darker moments, though pedalling impacted well and much of the rhythmic detail was capably presented.  Selling sundry goods achieved a very good level of control and energy, revealing the different sections of the narrative with confidence. A still lighter, more effortless dispatch was called for during the more taxing corners, though the sprightly main tune sprang to life with good vitality and an adventurous range of musical effects.  Both performances were effective in their sense of conviction and overall range of interpretive ideas. While there was room for even greater verve and lightness of touch during the more challenging, dextrous parts, a thoughtful and musically aware overview carried the playing forward very well overall.  Much to celebrate here - very best wishes for the future!"
doXYGXKj,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Pop Corn No. 18 from Confections: A Piano Sweet,Akira Yuyama,Doctor gradus ad parnassum,Debussy,94,"In ’Popcorn’ a brisk tempo was adopted and the hands were carefully synchronised. There was a good level of all round detail in terms of articulation and dynamic variation. The more lyrical middle passage was elegantly shaped and the important structural moments were thoughtfully highlighted. There was a small smudge of harmony in the pedalling and the odd very minor note blemish occurred but you caught the cheeky character most effectively in this stylish account.  The Debussy flowed briskly, with effective washes of sound. Changes of harmony were carefully pointed through your tasteful touches of rubato, whilst the melodic line sang through the textures soulfully. There was an unexpected temporary lapse in the latter stage of the piece but elsewhere the playing was full of colour and sparkle, enjoying incisive articulations and a sense of poetry during the more reflective moments.  The programme was presented with authority and professionalism. You took care to allow breathing space between items, if just slightly overstating the preparation time taken before beginning each piece. There was a commanding level of technical agility and security, with just one brief interruption occurring in the Debussy. The contrasting styles and characters were vividly projected, however, with a full-blooded range of tone colours and elegance in the tapering of phrases, in addition to some imaginative use of rubato. All in all this was a polished and communicative performance.  Persuasive and engaging piano playing - congratulations!"
eAjZqAwq,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Allegro in F,Mozart,Always with me,from Spirited Away,76,"The Mozart Allegro in F was played with a buoyant feeling of character and with the particularly crisp articulation you brought a sense of energy and spirit to the playing. The rhythms weren’t quite even however, sometimes affecting the consistency of pulse and metre, and while you always retained a confident sense of tonal projection there was scope for more dynamic nuance throughout.  Always with Me flowed tenderly, and you engaged fully with the reflective mood of the music. Ideally paced and with smoothly connected legato lines there was clear expressive intent, just needing a little more poise and shape at certain moments, though the ending was achieved with effective control.  Your playing brought musical insight to the fore and there was especially effective characterful differentiation between the two pieces, while you played with a poised sense of presentation. Rhythmical consistency was less secure in the first of the works, but otherwise you showed a degree of technical security and there was confident communication throughout.  Congratulations on bringing such positive sensitivity of style and mood to your playing."
edlNBqbx,13-15,Up to Grade 5,"Tarantella Twist: Piano Grades Are Go!, Grade 2-3",Victoria Proudler,"Allegretto: Number 3 from For Children, Vol. 2",Béla Bartók,73,"Tarantella Twist was largely accurate and showed creativity in dynamics and phrasing. Still more evenness in the transitions between hands was called for, along with extra overall verve and panache to bring out the music's vivacious, sparkling character. Its best regions were varied in tone and drew out the character in the music.  The Bartok performance had a good level of accuracy and overall control. There was the possibility of greater detail in articulation, dynamics and tonal grading, though flexibility was shown at ends of phrases, and the music's jocular spirit won through well.  In both pieces there was a very good level of engagement, and much was accurately presented. Additional lightness of touch and rhythmic ease could have driven the playing forward with still greater energy and impact, though speeds were well gauged and there was a purposeful approach to commend.  Very best wishes for your future piano playing!"
ejLrnonO,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Rumores De La Catela,Isaac Albeniz,Over The Bars,J. P. Johnson,64,"The portion of the Albeniz that was presented in the video had suitable Spanish character, and a lot of the articulation and projection was clear with good control of texture. The pedal supported this well, and there were moments of flexible tempo which were expressively well designed, if sometimes slightly overdone in terms of sustaining balance of flow. There were imprecisions in the rhythmic detail, causing losses of metrical shape, and only a segment of the piece was presented, the recorded performance commencing mid-phrase.   ”Over the Bars” began boldly in terms of dynamics, with controlled tempo ensuring clear pulse. There were good contrasts in the articulation, allowing plenty of colour and diversity between staccato and more flamboyant, sustained playing. The pedal largely supported the latter, and for the most part the character of the music came across well. There were some errors, though, and moments of less precise note placement or even flow, where the pulse slightly jogged. Nevertheless, and despite harmonic integrity sometimes challenged by the imprecisions, a wide dynamic range was in place and melody lines were clear.   As a performance there were well-taken opportuntiies to colour the music and present the specific styles and characters of the two pieces. The first piece was incomplete, though, and the resulting partial account left it feeling unresolved, particularly in terms of the abrupt way in which it started. Technical precision was not always successfully achieved and there were some misunderstandings around rhythm and metre, but the playing was certainly lively and had variety, revealing some awareness of style.   Thank you for sharing your playing and best wishes for continued fulfillment in your piano studies."
empQpgJl,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Il Porco Rosso,Joe Hisaishi,Selling Sundry Goods,Peixun Chen,83,"Expressive statements were bold and individual in the Hisaishi, and most were convincing in communicating the lyrical narrative. Tonal control was on the robust side, though, and though this suited some of the more climactic passages, there needed to be more light and shade in the playing. The rubato approach often suited the style, but it was sometimes too pronounced for the jazz idiom, with a need to balance better the sense of pulse - to underpin the rhythms - and the song-like flow. Notes were mostly in place and there was plenty of clear and effective melodic projection.  The Chen was bright, energetic and bold in outlook. Rhythmic intricacies were often adeptly managed, allowing for assured momentum and passages of quite exciting delivery. The central, slower section needed more of a sense of forward flow, to allow the melodic interplay to have shape and musical meaning, and some of the playing lacked tonal lightness and finesse. There was scope for a little less pedal support in quicker moments, but much of the character of the music came across. Articulation was often purposeful and there was lots of bold emphasis.  This was a well paced performance and you accentuated the vivid contrast between the two pieces well, though there was a slightly abrupt end to the performance overall. Delivery was not always tidy and sometimes over-zealous in projection, but there was musical insight in evidence and some effective characterisation and contrast. There needed to be greater stylistic authenticity in the Hisaishi to convince with the jazz idiom, but in much of the outer sections of the Chen the playing was exciting.  Thank you for sharing your playing - it was enjoyable to hear, and there was a lot of positive and musical work!"
eyGNgaGw,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Prelude in C sharp minor,Stephen Heller,Allegro,Friedrich Kuhlau,89,"The phrases of the Heller were shaped with effective tonal graduation and rubato, and the contrasts of tone as the melody transferred to the left hand were well judged.  Evenness was compromised in the left hand semiquavers, and as the piece progressed, there were some slips of coordination between the hands.  However, with just room for even greater dynamic width, this was an accurate and musically contoured account.  Tonal delicacy supported the opening of the Kuhlau, and dynamic contrasts were made as the exposition progressed.  Despite clarity of articulation in their delivery, some of the semiquavers laboured a little, and not all rhythms were precisely defined, slightly too much flexibility allowed,  Nonetheless, this was a musical account which saw a good degree of overall technical security.   Throughout this performance, you maintained composure and poise, delivery of the programme showing a high degree of accuracy.  There was scope for even greater projection of stylistic engagement, and although the contrasting styles were defined, the Kuhlau saw slightly too much flexibility for the classical idiom.  However, musical intention and shaping were evident at all times, with focus consistent.  Congratulations on this excellent performance.  I particularly enjoyed the tonal shaping you made in the melodic lines."
gBJQLAJq,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Sonatina Op. 20 no. 1, 1st movement",Friedrich Kuhlau,Waltz in A minor,Frédéric Chopin,72,"The Kuhlau was played with a confident sense of forward flow in the main and the hands were tidily synchronised. The semiquaver figures tripped over a little and met with unevenness at times, whilst a lighter accompanying part would have facilitated a more clearly-defined melodic line. The charm of the style was effectively caught overall and whilst there was a need for further elegance in the tapering of phrase-endings, the moments of drama were well caught through your vigorous tone in the minor key passages.  In the Chopin there was a suitably uplifting air to your waltz, provided by a well-clipped LH accompaniment. The melodic line needed to be a little less dominated by the lower part at times and whilst the use of rubato was welcome, there was a need for a slightly more consistent rhythmical flow in places. The occasional note slip took place but the fluidity was well maintained overall and the phrases were always thoughtfully contoured.  You presented the programme in a professional manner, with just room for a little more sense of breathing space in between the two items. The technical aspect of the work was largely free-flowing and secure in its note placements, though with occasional diversions occurring and some areas of less stable coordination in the more rapid passagework. The contrasting styles were well realised, with careful shaping of phrases, if having scope for more clearly projected melodic lines and for further phrasing detail. The overall performance was nonetheless committed and well structured.  I enjoyed your playing very much - well done and good luck in all your future musical endeavours!"
gDoZkXyY,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Allegro,Friedrich Kuhlau,Jazz Exercise No 2,Oscar Peterson,90,"There was a very lyrical, expressive approach to the Kuhlau, which was balanced against evident respect for stylistic traits such as simplicity of texture and terracing of dynamics. Subtle pedal use supported the projection and there was adept technical facility, ensuring mostly very even rhythmic control, with only small blemishes in the evenness. Tonal shaping was slightly affected by occasional instability in the sense of line, and there was sometimes just a little lack of clarity in terms of dynamic and tempo contrast, but the playing was authoritative and convincing.   In the Peterson a bright tempo supported much adept and well directed passagework, and phrases had clear light and shade that revealed engagement with the jazzy style and personal expressive design. Subtlety in this shaping was effective, but there were some brief note-placement blemishes which slightly masked the harmonic detail, though not the positive continuity and energy. The swing style emanated clearly through the rhythms and the left hand supported the melodic detail with lightness and control.   Overall, this was a very assured performance with convincing and often compelling musical insight, presented with excellent pacing and strong communication. Expressive statements were sometimes slightly too broad for the respective styles, but you conveyed musical meanings and highlighted the contrast between your two chosen pieces, supporting this with adept technical work.   I thoroughly enjoyed your exceptional playing - well done!"

As the piece went on the repeated chords were sometimes a little too prominent in the texture, and there was room to widen the dynamic range and give the phrases a stronger sense of shape and line, but there was something of the character conveyed.  Allegretto was brisk in tempo and played at a lively pace with the tempo change towards the end very effectively managed. The detached articulation was realised, although there was room to make more of the accents and for more vivid contrasts in the dynamics to bring the music to life more fully. But for one melodic smudge, all was securely in place in this spirited performance.  This was a committed performance of two well contrasted pieces, which were characterised through their contrasts in articulation, although a broader dynamic range would have brought greater stylistic variety. Delivery was largely controlled and there was a good sense of communication throughout.  A very good performance - well done."

Rhythmic patterns remained precise and the hand were neatly coordinated. The ornaments were carefully incorporated into the musical line, and again these had a brightness to adorn the line. The chords were well placed and the dotted patterns were crisp and incisive, and there was effective tonal colouring in this stylish account.  The Chopin waltz began at a steady pace, and the lilting dance like style was clearly portrayed. The left hand chords were neatly placed and lifted, and the hands were balanced and coordinated. The right hand tripped along brightly in quicker sections, and touches of colour and rubato were used to good effect. The grading of dynamics and rubato was sensitively managed and this was stylish and communicative playing.  A well contrasted programme presented with technical accomplishment, and an air of authority and clear musical awareness. A range of tonal effects was explored and the detailing was nuanced and mature. An outstanding and communicative performance, very well done!"

The hands were mostly balanced and coordinated, but there was some slight rhythmic unease at times, and also some smudging in the notes. A measure of haste as the account progressed caused some loss of definition, and the detailing could have been further explored. Some warm tones were found and the style of the piece was well conveyed, deapite the haste.  The opening theme in the Bartok was well projected and a sweet tone was found. The chords were neatly placed and the hands were coordinated. The contrasting tempi were used to good effect as the piece progressed, but the quicker sections were not always fully defined and greater clarity in the fingerwork would have been welcome. There was some untidiness in the final variation but the ending was gentle and the narrative was evident in this vividly descriptive account.  There was some contrast in the programme and some interesting tonal effects were explored throughout. There was some untidiness in the technical delivery, and a little more restraint in the tempi would have enhanced the styles in several places. However, the sense of presentation was poised and there were clear signs of musical involvement and conviction. The final section of the Bartok was particularly impressive in its descriptive qualities. Congratulations on your performance!"

This was polished playing, evidenced in the beautifully shaped phrasing and attention to tone quality. Some slight loss of momentum in the final section but the energetic direction was always projected.  ’Twilight’ was expressively presented with an easy fluidity. There were many subtleties of colour and nuance which added emotional depth.  This was a confident performance which projected the mood of each piece with authority. Stage presence was calm and engaging, allowing space around the music.  I enjoyed this performance. Congratulations on some outstanding playing."
gmrZXPmp,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Jester’s Jig,Chee-Hwa Tan,Minnelied,Heinrich Hofmann,84,"The energised character of the Jester’s Jig was well captured from the start, with fluent phrases, a bright tone and articulated lines. Whilst a sense of direction was always conveyed there was scope for even tighter control of rhythm and pulse, though the hands were largely well controlled. There was some effective shaping, and although there was scope for this to be even more vibrant and energised, the notes were reliable in relation to pitch and there was some controlled pacing of the phrases, allowing them to breathe.  The second piece was soft and lyrical from the start. There was flexibility of the pulse, which was suitable and stylistically appropriate and phrases had dynamic direction. The pedal work was largely well managed, with the textures clear for the most part. The odd loss of clarity, blemish of pitch or clipped note, but the performance overall was atmospheric and communicative.  This was a confident performance, where the parts were clean and clear, and the sense of performance was evident through the poise when playing, as well as the pacing between the individual items. The different musical identities of the pieces came across mostly effectively, conveying a stylistic understanding, but leaving room for even more vivid and expressive portrayal overall. A few inconsistencies, though these were generally short-lived, with the other technical deamands of the programme well met.

There were some organised and effective dynamic contrasts, with the soft tone both sensitive and engaging. The odd clipped note, but otherwise this was largely fluent, with the notes accurate in relation to pitch.  Phrases were smooth and delicate in The Song of Twilight, with the pedal largely well controlled. The lines rushed somewhat, leaving room for them to breathe a little more, and there was scope for the tone within the accompaniment part particularly, to be more lyrical and expressive. The ending was well controlled though and stylistically shaped.  There was a clear sense of poise and control during playing, and some organised pacing between the individual items. The pieces were contrasting, with some effective tonal colours communicated, but room to explore more vivid sonorities.

This was an positive performance, where hands worked well together and the different characters and moods were captured."
gqAjOrGw,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude and Fugue no.16 in G minor, BWV 861",J.S. Bach,"Scherzo Humoristique ""The Cat and The Mouse""",Aaron Copland,93,"The trills were mostly light and even at the start of the Bach Prelude and the hands were suitably balanced and cordinated. The rhythmic patterns were precise and defined and the notes were neatly placed. Phrases were given shaping and touches of colour and tonal variation. The opening theme in the fugue was given detail and this was heard as the voices entered. There was some loss of the legato styling in more complex sections but the playing was poised and stylish.    The Cat and the Mouse was played with an effective assortment of dynamic colours and tonal effects, and the relaxed and fluid tempo was apt. Some of the light playing was particularly impressive and the fingerwork was delicate and well defined, in both staccato and legato sections. The fortissimo chords could have had even more impact but the quick moving chords were mostly reliable and the interplay between the hands was neatly negotiated. The tale was clearly described with touches of cunning and drama.    Some very stylish and accomplished playing heard here and the programme was suitably contrasted. The sense of presentation was outward and communicative in this most engaging performance. Very well done!"
groQNxKL,13-15,Up to Grade 5,An Autumn Leaf,Christine Donkin,The Night of the Sleepy Panda,Edric Tan,74,"An Autumn Leaf moved along at a suitably serene pace, with good note accuracy sustained throughout. Pedal assisted the music’s autumnal charm, though there were less well cleared harmonies and areas that called for an even more sensitive balance between the hands. The best areas achieved expressive clarity, a bright cantabile and firm dynamic involvement, leaving room for even greater smoothness and contouring, more so at ends of phrases. It came to a thoughtful, measured conclusion.  The Night of the Sleepy Panda had a gentle, soporific feel to it, and varied articulation details added welcome contrast, with pedal enterprisingly used. While the sweet melody was often shapely as well as singing in tone, not all opportunities for expressive nuance were taken, and the left hand’s repeated accompaniment could have been more subdued, especially during the quieter, dreamier moments in the music. Hand coordination was tidily controlled, with well played broken chords heard later on, and a clear sense of engagement was good to hear as the performance came to its peaceful end.  In both pieces a very good sense of musical character came through, and note accuracy was maintained. The repertoire could usefully have contrasted more vividly, with one piece having a livelier energy to it, and there was scope for even greater musical detail and expressive ease. This was a poised performance overall, with moments of calm welcome in between pieces, conveying a good sense of musicality overall.  Congratulations, and best wishes for your future piano playing!"
jBRrNZqa,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Etude Op.10 No.5,Chopin,Sonata in F major K.332 1st movement,Mozart,80,"A suitably energetic tempo was adopted and there was a bright and confident tone. The articulation was crisp, with the the rapid triplet work being very efficiently negotiated for the most part, barring a few small deviations, for example in the middle and towards the end. There was a need for more tonal nuancing and for further elegance and spaciousness of phrasing around important structural ’corners’, but you carried it all off with appropriate flamboyance.  A regular pulse was established and you articulated incisively. The semiquaver passagework was comfortably handled in the main although there was a little blurring of harmony where the pedalling needed further refinement. The playing had a strong level of conviction and there was awareness of the contrasting dynamic levels although the phrases required more graceful shaping and subtlety of tone to match the poise of Mozart’s writing. The occasional LH diminished chord was misjudged but otherwise there was largely very assured coordination in this rhythmically-solid account.  The programme was presented with an air of confidence emanating from a high level of technical and rhythmical assurance. There were a few small blemishes in the demanding passagework of the Chopin but the articulation was executed with much authority. Stylistically there was a need for greater subtlety of phrasing, notably in the Mozart, where ends of phrases required more elegant tapering, but the dynamic content was conscientiously realised and the overall performance was firmly committed.  You played with impressive fluency and vigour and there was much to admire in your work. Well done and good luck in all your future piano playing endeavours!"
jVErdOxz,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Taccota,Martin Cuéllar,Spanish Polylogarhythms,Andrea Vicari,92,"Strong, purposeful and committed from the start. The rhythmic components of the Taccato were incisive, with phrases contoured and stylistically expressive. The dynamic direction within the outer sections particularly was vibrant, engaging and persuasive. Although there was room for the middle section to explore a wider range of tonal colours, and in parts for the use of staccato to be even more crisp, there was some cohesion between the sections, with the performance overall assurred and fluent.  The stylistic nuances and characterisation of the Spanish Polylogarhythms was clear, with some expressive shaping and communicative colours and tonal variety. The textures were largely well controlled, though the accompaniment left room to be more sensitive as the piece progressed. For all a sense of momentum was maintained, there needed to be tighter rhythmic control and reliability of pulse - encompassing the ’with precision’ performance direction more convincingly. The playing was vibrant and bold though, and had an air of authority.  This was a confident performance, where the lines were clean and characterisation was purposeful. There was a strong sense of involvement and the playing was vivid and bold throughout. There was scope to explore the softer side of the instrument more persuasively, extending the range of tonal sonorities, but the musical identities were communicatively conveyed. Although there was room for tighter rhythmic control in parts of the programme, the technical demands were largely met with positivity.  This was a highly energsied and enjoyable programme, with the playing persuasive and mostly well controlled."
jjMBwgjn,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Etude in A minor, Op 58, No.6",Ludvig Schytte,"Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence",Ryuichi Sakamoto,72,"The Etude saw a suitable sense of flair, fingerwork in the semiquavers largely even initially.  Consistency in this respect was lost as the piece progressed, and the central section would have benefitted from greater clarity of pitch centring and chordal textures.  However, individual phrases were musically shaped and some tonal contrast was made between sections.  'Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence' saw effective use of rubato, and some tonal variation was made between the contrasting styles of writing.  Although some dynamic variation was apparent, with accents particularly well used to define melodic interest and rhythmic character in the chordal playing, there was scope for use of a wider dynamic range, and phrase shaping did not always support musical direction.  However, despite a couple of slips latterly, overall accuracy was retained, with harmonic outline clear.    This was a poised performance which saw overall focus and a good degree of accuracy, the contrasts of style defined.  Blemishes of technical consistency and slight limitation in dynamic range impacted in part, and further stylistic engagement would have been appropriate, although you played wth confidence throughout.  Congratulations on your very good performance, with control of textural balancing a highlight.  Best wishes for your future musical ventures."
jldpvzkW,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Liebestraume Nr.3,Franz Liszt,"Visions fugitives, op. 22 - XIV",Sergei Prokofiev,71,"In the Liszt, there was clear understanding of the character of the music, and its expressive scale. A wide dynamic range was in use, allowing for vivid light and shade and a suitably emotive and climactic central section. Tonal and textural control were not always sufficiently in place to support the interpretative design, though, and projection and balance were inconsistent at times, where technical demands were more to the fore. Though this made for some unease in the flow and general evenness of sound, notes were mostly in place and there was insight in the use of rubato, with some poignantly calm moments to contrast with the bolder statements.  Most of the notes were under the fingers in the Prokofiev and there was awareness of the mood and general musical character. Some of the hand-crossing and articulation detail was well realised, and there was dynamic contrast and some emphasis. Rhythmic coordination was unsettled, though, and projection also faltered in the more intricate passages, resulting in inconsistent tempo and clarity at times. The momentum was sustained, nonetheless, and there was some conviction in the communication.  This was a well paced overall performance of two vividly contrasting pieces. The diverse palette of technical and expressive demands that they presented was managed to an extent, but unease in flow and coordination did affect both, in terms of balance and clarity of line. Nevertheless, the stylistic understanding was in place and this provided a foundation for some interpretative conviction.  Thank you for presenting these two pieces, and well done on your performance. I enjoyed it and wish you well in your studies."
jvDAORWz,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Sonata in F minor op.2 No.1 (1st Movement),L.V. Beethoven,Jardins Sous La Pluie,C. Debussy,91,"Beethoven’s Sonata movement immediately captured the classical style, phrases musically shaped with tonal graduation and the tempo used suitably buoyant. Musical details were observed, with room for just a little more tonal weight in the ’sforzandi’, and throughout, a sense of drive was evident, despite slight pulse fluctuation and rushing on occasion, particularly in the second subject material and development. Nevertheless, this was a suitably dramatic account.  The Debussy conveyed the programmatic outline, flexibility of tone and clear projection of melodic interest highlighted throughout.  Just occasionally, even greater tonal weight in the louder figures, along with further shaping of the repetitive accompanying patterns and even more tempo flexibility, would have enhanced this. However, technical facility supported the accuracy and energy of the playing, and this was an impressive account.  Throughout this performance, you played with focus and clear engagement. The contrasting styles of the pieces were defined, and with just room for even greater tonal nuance on occasion, musical shaping fitted the outlines of both.  Many congratulations on this impressive and exceptional performance, your playing showing all-round musical security and conviction."
jwEKVKll,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Sonatina Op 88 No.4, 1st Movement",Friedrich Kuhlau,Etude Allegro,Yoshinao Nakada,88,"The Kuhlau had a musically shaped melody, with careful articulation and stylistic phrasing. Parts were neatly coordinated and balanced, with fluid definition in quick passages - apart from fleeting untidy and unrhythmic moments along the way. Occasionally uneven tone mid-phrase was slightly unsettling, but there was musical flexibility between phrases, and clear lyrical direction and dynamic shaping here.    The Nakada began with assured rhythmic control and musical focus. Chords were bold and neatly placed - though less consistently later, with a few notes not quite projecting, and occasional fleeting untidiness between hands. Sections were effectively contrasted, with sustained phrases in the middle - though room for more fluid legato lines and a quieter dynamic range here. The pulse in outer sections was maintained, although some passages were slightly rushed and unrhythmic, particularly towards the end; melodic lines were distinct in all parts, with characterful energy maintained throughout.    The performance was consistently poised and well paced, with confident musical direction and mainly assured technical control; there was convincing musical shaping and engagement with both musical styles.    I particularly liked the sensitive and instinctive transitions between different moods in the Nakada."
jxdaKZMr,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Ecossaise in G,Ludwig van Beethoven,Mozzie,Elissa Milne,90,"The Beethoven opened with confident momentum and light staccato chords. Parts were neatly coordinated, with a rhythmic and musically shaped melody, and stylistic phrasing in both parts. Fleeting hesitancy on the final repeat - and scope for wider dynamic range and more variety in repeated sections; overall there was assured continuity here.  ’Mozzie’ was carefully presented, with bright, coordinated staccato chords. The melody was carefully phrased and rhythmic, apart from occasionally anticipated beats. There was secure accuracy and thoughtful dynamic shaping here, with characterful momentum.  This was a poised performance, with different styles conveyed through careful musical details and dynamic shaping. Technical details were consistently secure, with assured direction throughout.  I particularly enjoyed the stylistic lightness you conveyed in the Beethoven."
jyEXpNaB,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Scherzino op77no.2,Moritz Moszkowwski,Bujkalo Szivarvany - Hiding Rainbow,P.E. Wolf,86,"The Moskowski had lively momentum and mainly consistent light staccato throughout, with tight ensemble between parts, and clear melodic direction and dynamic shaping. Small blemishes and uneven moments did not disrupt continuity, with well-judged musical flexibility between phrases. The middle section flowed sensitively, with sustained legato phrases - though scope for a wider dynamic range here, particularly quieter moments. Fleeting rhythmic unsteadiness between hands, and a slightly unsteady transition back to the final quick section; overall the vibrant mood was captured, with reliable control and characterful assurance.   The Wolf had a warm and evenly projected tone, with lyrical shape and direction through phrases. Parts were carefully balanced, with chords mainly neatly placed - though not consistently, particularly in the louder section towards the end. Fleeting rhythmic unsteadiness in the middle section, with room for much wider dynamic and tonal range across the piece, particularly quieter playing - and for more time and musical flexibility between phrases. Small hesitations and blemishes were quickly recovered; overall there was expressive melodic flow and sensitivity for the mood.   This was a committed and fluent performance, with secure technical control and thoughtful musical phrasing throughout. Room for more time and flexibility in places, and for a wider tonal range overall – but there was sincere musical engagement here.   I particularly enjoyed the bright energy you conveyed in the Moszkowski."
kANEVmYZ,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella Twist,Victoria Proudler,The Muppet Show Theme,Jim Henson & Sam Pottle,74,"’Tarantella Twist’ flowed musically, with rhythmic legato quavers passed neatly between hands. There was reliable accuracy and steady continuity here, with parts mainly coordinated, apart from fleeting untidy moments in the middle, and at the end. Scope for bolder forward direction and more dynamic shaping, but this was fluent.  ’The Muppet Show Theme’ was carefully played, with a rhythmic melody and neatly placed accompanying chords. The tempo was cautious but consistent, apart from fleeting hesitancy and rhythmic unsteadiness; room for more assured energy and direction - and more dynamic variety - but this flowed securely.  This was a careful performance, with a successful transition between styles - though pacing between pieces was slightly hurried. Technical details were mainly secure, apart from a few blemishes and untidy moments - and tempi were slightly cautious; overall this was reliable and fluent.  I particularly liked the fluid legato lines you achieved in ’Tarantella Twist’."
kKxQrNzO,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Three parts invention in C major BWV 787,J.S.Bach,Alla Turca third movement from Sonata in A major,Mozart,80,"Bach’s Invention was immediately clear in expressive shape, and growing dynamic involvement also added variety. The resolution of ornaments occasionally caused unevenness, but this was a confident and stylish performance, delivered at a well judged and energised tempo.   Mozart’s Alla Turca was buoyant and much of the articulation was consistently delivered. However, the second half was less resilient in terms of technical control, and passages of right hand semiquavers tended to sag in momentum. Spread left hand chords were also disruptive at times, but the grand character was definitely understood and often conveyed with determination.  This was a purposeful performance, with well judged tempi and plenty of musical input. The second piece was less restrained and ornaments caused slight unevenness in the Bach. The absence of a spoken introduction impacted the personal connection, but there was plenty of stylish playing to enjoy here.  Well done. This was spirited and musical playing."
kLVxbZoJ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Spiritoso op.36 no.3 in C major 1st movt,Clementi,A Town with an Ocean View,Joe Hisaishi,86,"Melodic lines were vividly projected and the bright character of the music came across strongly at the start. Notes were secure and the left hand was often light in support. Tempo needed to retain its initial impetus - as rhythms became more consistently intricate some momentum was lost in the forward flow, though the character was kept through very crisply detached articulation. There were occasional moments of less consistent projection or rhythmic evenness, particularly around ornaments, but the playing had much light and shade in its dynamic design, which was stylish.  The changing moods and colours of the Hisaishi were convincingly conveyed and tempo was well judged, with a little insightful flexiblity to accentuate the ebb and flow. Notes were accurate though there was one left-hand misplacement, and some unease in the projection which in the middle part slightly unsettled the tonal balance. Vivid changes in articulation were effective; there was scope to shape melodic lines with even more conviction, but you successfully communicated the character of the piece.  This was a poised and focused performance from beginning to end. You paced the two pieces well, projected them with care and thought for the narrative, and supported the playing with secure technical detail. There were some blemishes and inconsistencies along the way, in terms of momentum and balance, but much of the playing was colourful and expressive statements were authentic.  Thank you for sharing your excellent playing, and very best wishes for continued success and enjoyment of your piano journey."
kLpLXWmw,10-12,Up to Grade 5,An adventure of a Stray Cat,Chinatsu Matsuda,Ballade,J.F. Burgmuller,79,"An Adventure of a Stray Cat began at a apt tempo and was securely played but for the addition of an extra beat into one of the bars each time it was played, briefly upsetting the stablity of the pulse.  The articulation was clear and, although there was room for stronger dynamic contrasts throughout, the character was conveyed in this spirited account.  Ballade was brisk in pace and securely played throughout, with stylish  contrasts in dynamics and articulation, and the accents well pointed.  There was room to balance the hands a little more carefully to allow the LH melodic lines to be more fully projected from the texture and lighten the accompanying chords, but this was a characterful account overall, full of energy and momentum.  This was an engaging and well communicated performance of two strongly contrasted pieces.  Poise was maintained throughout, with the pacing and sequencing well managed.  But for rhythmic errors in the first half of the performance, delivery was controlled throughout, with the characterisation just needing a wider dynamic range to be more fully effective.  A well projected performance.  I enjoyed your playing - well done."
kOzwAbGb,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Minuet in G,Anonymous,The Sad Ghost,Nancy Litten,76,"A bright tempo suited the lively character of the Minuet and there were generally accurate notes, though the left hand contained imprecisions in the middle section. There were rhythmically uneven moments, particularly in terms of clarity and coordination and caused by a slightly urgent approach, but you successfully caught the dance-like character of the music. Dynamic changes were effective where clearly communicated and there was plenty of appropriate articulation.   The Litten began with suitable melancholy and mystery, thanks to your light tone and steady, considered counting. Contrasts in articulation added colour. As the principal, lyrical melody developed, the left-hand notes supported lightly and evenly, with scope for just a little more overt shaping in the top part to give the phrases greater direction, particularly as you neared the loudest point. This part was quite hurried, but there was lots of light and shade elsewhere, and the ending was effectively delicate.  Your understanding of style and mood came across particularly well in the second piece, where there was lots of expression and characterisation. Despite technical misgivings, the Minuet also had character and playing overall was well paced and balanced.   Well done - your playing was secure and characterful, and I enjoyed hearing it. All the best to you for your continued musical study."
kQYdgppD,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Spiritoso (1st movement from Sonatina in C op.36 No.3),M.Clementi,Someone You Loved,Lewis Capaldi,90,"Sparkling clarity and detail were present from the outset of the Clementi Sonatina movement, and you vividly captured the musical character. Commendable dexterity and control informed the delivery, with only fleeting moments of tonal and rhythmic unevenness present, and a musical feeling of flexibility brought a keen sense of style to the fore, especially at the elegant phrase endings.  Ease of flow and effective use of rubato brought sensitivity and expressive insight to the opening of Someone You Loved. There were moments as the piece unfolded when a little more shape was possible, and the phrases would have benefited from space and poise at times, but mostly this was a sincere account.  Your playing showed real commitment and sensitivity, and a keen air of conviction was ever-present. The Clementi in particular showed real stylistic integrity, and while more expressive input was sometimes possible in the second piece, the overall impact of your playing was confident and musically defined.  Congratulations on playing of assurance and compelling involvement!"
keDVqKOw,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Von fremden Landern und Menschen (No. 1 from Kinderscenen, Op. 15)",Schumann,In the Groove (from 20 Piano Studies),Mike Cornick,79,"Opening with a quietly intense performance of the first of Schumann’s Kinderscenen, you showed musical sensitivity from the outset. Tonal consistency needed to be more certain to ensure all the notes sounded in the left-hand, and there was room for more lyrical projection of the theme, but musical insight was clear and this flowed with ease.  In the Groove by contrast was lively and vibrant, with crispness of articulation providing spirit and character. The rhythms weren’t fully precise however, with some figures hurrying slightly and the overall pulse needing firmer consistency, but you otherwise engaged well with the musical style.  While there was scope for more time and space at the conclusion of the works to allow the music to settle, you nonetheless brought a positive air of performance awareness to the presentation and there was sensitivity of style and mood. Firmer tonal support was sometimes needed, as well as precision of rhythmic definition, but note accuracy was dependably secure throughout.  Congratulations on bringing such sensitivity and vivid character to your playing!"
keXBOaOK,16-18,Grade 5 and above,"Etude Op.10 No.4, 'Torrent'",F. Chopin,Pour le Piano : I. Prelude in A minor,Debussy,94,"A brilliant and lively opening in the Chopin described the energy and relentlessness of the torrent, and the account had a clear sense of direction and flow. The hands were well balanced and coordinated and the chords were mostly tidy and secure. A wider dynamic range could have been explored but the technical delivery was reliable, and the fingerwork was agile and controlled.    The left hand was suitably accented and projected at the start of the Debussy, and the semiquavers were light and even in the accompaniment. The interplay between the hands was effectively managed throughout and an assortment of musical techniques, and tonal qualities were explored to good effect. More chordal passages were largely controlled and the glissandi, and flourishes were light and delicate, and well defined, and the playing showed technical accomplishment throughout. Pacing and rubato were subtely nuanced and the style was effectively communicated in this assured account.    A greater contrast between the chosen pieces would have been welcome, though there was a clear sense of performance awareness and the interpretations of both pieces were stylish, and true to the genres. The playing overall showed much technical accomplishment and there was a clear sense of musical involvement and assurance. An exceptional and engaging performance. Very well done."
klQPDrPG,7-9,Up to Grade 5,WALTZ IN B MINOR,FRANZ SCHUBERT,LA TARANTELLE,J.F.F. BURGMULLER,88,"Buoyancy was captured at the start of the waltz, with touches of pedal adding dimension to the sounds. Bolder phrase shapes were possible, however, and the melody needed to sing with further expression. The playing was a little one-coloured at times, but the dance element was sensed, and a lively mood prevailed.  The ’Tarantella’ was approached with energy, and some graded dynamics were explored. The essential ’skip’ was captured, but more clarity and control were necessary in some of the fast figures, with untidy co-ordination present in places. A decisive ending was displayed, nonetheless, with forward flow confident.  A good range of dynamics and articulation were achieved in these interpretations, though more contrast was possible between the two pieces as both were dances, and control was not always reliable. Despite this, tempo choices were lively, with the necessary rhythmic vitality conveyed.  There was real conviction displayed in the final work, and an affinity with bright moods was evident. A most enjoyable performance."
knnQrXNJ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Les Sauvages,Rameau,New Kid,Christopher Norton,84,"There was a good feel for the style of the Rameau, and the delivery was paced well with some nuanced flexibility in the tempo. Ornamentation was mostly apt and there was some effective light and shade in the dynamics, supporting the interplay between the parts. A detached approach, particularly in the quavers, suited the style but not always the momentum, with a need for more of a sense of line to help direct the melodic detail. There was also some imbalance between the hands, which sometimes caused minor jogs in the rhythmic tidiness, but pulse was well sustained and the playing was positive throughout.  In the Norton you picked a steady tempo, which afforded room for much of the articulation detail to come across. Right-hand parts were well projected and there was some good use of accents, particularly to underpin syncopations. A combination of slightly reserved tempo choice and rigidity in the rhythms robbed the piece of some of its impetus and energy, though, and there were pockets of less well coordinated technical detail, though these were never disruptive to the pulse. Dynamic changes added colour, and in places like the ending this was effective in accentuating the jazzy character.  Overall this was a secure performance, well directed in terms of projection and with plenty of technical control. The shaping needed to be more consistent, with both pieces suffering from rigidity in rhythmic impetus and tonal imbalance between the hands. There was commitment to interpretative and expressive ideas, though, and these were well communicated in a focused performance.  I enjoyed hearing, this! Your playing carried weight and authenticity, and this helped a lot in the communication of your musical ideas. I wish you well in your future studies."
kvODDEKJ,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Spinnerlied,Ellmenreich,Minuet in G,Bach,74,Spinnerlied was appropriately energetic and displayed much clarity of fingerwork. There were occasional untidy corners where the hands lost alignment and the accents could have been more smoothly integrated into the lines. Bold phrasing and dynamics added excitement and the ending was very poised in execution.  The Bach Minuet had an elegant approach with much graceful ornamentation. Some slightly rushed cadences and small stumbles rocked the momentum. However there was a strong sense of the dance throughout with playful articulation adding shape to the phrases.  The character of each piece was well-conveyed but a hurried presentation marred the effective playing. Greater time could have been taken between the pieces to allow for the change of mood.   I enjoyed the musical thought and detail of your programme. Well done on some very good playing.
lBmRMGaP,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Prelude in C Major from the Well-Tempered Clavier Book 1,J.S.Bach,"The Spanish Guitar, from Accents Around the World",William Gillock,78,"A bright and sincere tone was present from the start of the Bach, with lines smooth and fluent too. The pedal was well controlled and the phrases moved with a sense of direction, with some contoured and meaningful shaping. Notes were even, with the pitch exact, though there was scope to explore a wider range of sonorities. There was more effective use of dynamics as the piece developed, and the performance was secure and reliable.   Hands worked well together in The Spanish Guitar, and a sense of momentum was always maintained, though the rhythmic character needed to be more incisive and determined. The textures were balanced throughout, and although the performance overall left room to be more vibrant and communicative, there was some organised dynamic involvement, and the ending was clean and crisp.   The performance was organised, controlled and the textures were well balanced throughout. There was poise and control during the playing and when moving between the pieces. The different musical identities of the pieces came across in part, conveying an appropriate mood, but leaving room for more vivid and expressive stylistic portrayal. The technical demands of the programme were met with positivity.  There was some good playing on display here, with the technical aspects confidently met."
lDvgbqRr,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Fireworks Minuet,G.F.Handel,Berry's Smoothie,Nikki Yeoh,78,"The pulse achieved clarity in the Handel, with the tempo lively. Further detail and flexibility in the touch were needed to shape the phrases, however, with more joy and colour awaiting expression. Forward flow was sustained, nonetheless, with energy projected.  ’Berry’s Smoothie’ achieved variety in articulation, and there was bounce in the touch. Further rhythmic playfulness was possible, despite this, with bolder phrase shapes desirable. Although the interpretation was rather one-coloured, with the left hand sounding a little too heavy at times, vigour and ’drive’ were captured, and the tempo remained lively.  Assured forward flow was exhibited in these two interpretations, but greater contrast in mood was required between the two chosen pieces. A wider range of colour and expression were possible in the shaping of the phrases, with more finesse and variation awaiting capture to support even deeper engagement in the music. At times, the touch was a little heavy and rigid which weakened a sense of joy and the playfulness of the rhythms, but a variety of articulation was explored. Tempo choices were well judged, with some variation in dynamics achieved.  There were bold, decisive touches in your playing, and energy was not lacking. Keep up the good work!"
lENjnpZo,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Impromptu in Ab, Op 142 No.2 D 935",Schubert,Waltz KK IVb No.11 in A Minor,Frederic Chopin,85,"Schubert’s Impromptu was well judged in opening tempo, and the regal character was captured. Projecting the melody clearly above accompanying chords was not always managed and there was room for further delicacy in quieter passages. The Trio was more urgent in tempo and dynamic variety provided a sense of drama. This was a confident performance, though there was scope for even more expressive direction in longer lines.   Chopin’s Waltz No. 11 was gently lilting in approach, with some flexibility in the phrasing. There were opportunities to further explore stylistic freedom and textural colour, but the dancing character was firmly felt throughout.  This was confident and well shaped playing, demonstrating a good grasp of both styles. Refined detail was quite persuasive, though there was room for further flexibility in the Chopin, and for more carefully adjusted balance in the Schubert. Pacing had been given plenty of thought, and time between pieces gave this perfomance a clear feeling of poise and control. Your enjoyment was also clear throughout, and was often generously shared.  Congratulation on an excellent performance, and best wishes for future success and enjoyment."
lEZeRxmw,16-18,Grade 5 and above,The Man I Love,George Gershwin,"Allegro  con spirito from Sonata in C, K309 (first movement)",Mozart,62,"The Gershwin was played with effective tempo flexibility, chords largey even in their delivery.  There was scope for further tonal warmth and resonance, with phrase shaping not consistently appropriate, and increasing pitch blemish affected the music as it progressed.  However, the central section saw appropriate buoyancy and rhythmic character.  The Mozart saw suitable tonal brightness and vivacity.  Dynamic contrasts between sections helped to define the structural outline.  However, technical facility was not consistent, with pitch placement not fully secure, and with increasing variation of pulse occurring as the piece progressed.  Nevertheless, the bright tone was maintained, and the more confident moments were musically shaped.    You retained composure and focus across the course of the performance, even when you felt correction was necessary, and the contrasts of style were tonally defined.  Technical unease did tend to undermine delivery, although musical intention was clear throughout.  Thank you.  I enjoyed the tonal brightness of your Mozart, and wish you success in your future musical ventures."
lKPwWWPn,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Waltz in A minor,Chopin,Shooting Stars,Poul Ruders,78,"You brought a very expressive approach to the Chopin, particularly in terms of tempo and melodic shaping. This emphasised the lyrical qualities of the music, though the use of rubato needed to be balanced with more thought for the waltz character, with scope for more consistent forward motion in the pulse. The pedal tended to blur the harmonic detail, with clearer changes needed, but notes were all securely in place and there was clear and convincing musical engagement with the ebb and flow of the top line.  In the Ruders there was accuracy and sustained continuity, with largely even rhythmic playing and stable pulse. The chosen tempo was a little slower than the mark, and the dynamic often louder, which compromised the delicate, sparkling character suggested by the title, and robbed the delivery of some of its energy and momentum. There was scope for more tonal evenness, to emphasise the melodic interplay, but your projection of important notes was often clear. The closing bars were effective - here you controlled the tonal weight well and placed the final chord with sensitivity.  The performance was musically involved, poised and focused throughout, revealing a strong sense of engagement and understanding. This allowed you to communicate the music well, particularly in terms of personal interpretative ideas, which came across particularly successfully in the Chopin. Some more musically informed decisions and greater consistency in instrument management were needed at times, but the playing was largely secure and well projected.  Thank you for sharing your performance! I enjoyed hearing it and wish you continued fulfilment in your musical studies."
lXdjPvJO,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Moonscape,Edwin Roxburgh,Selling Sundry Goods,Peixun Chen,84,"The evocative, reflective sound-world of the Roxburgh was mostly well conveyed, with evidence of engagement with its colours and expressive scope, particularly through your command of dynamic and tempo changes. Technical detail was broadly in place, ensuring harmonic integrity and mostly melodic clarity, though with some unease in projecting and balancing, which left the texture inconsistent in terms of its fullness of sound and clarity of tone. Some of the tempo choices robbed the music of its forward flow and there was scope to make more of melodic projection where lines were more hidden within the texture. Quite bold dynamic changes were evident, though, and there was a good feel for the meaning of the ’Moonscape’ title.  ”Selling Sundry Goods” began with bright, crisp and bold sounds and there was good balance in the playing, allowing melodic lines to pervade clearly, whilst supported by often light and compelling accompanying textures and patterns. The more lyrical central section needed greater tonal shape and balance, with tendency for phrases to bulge in the middle, and some unease in coordinating the hands. Though there was a little instability as the dynamics increased, the general build to the return of the quicker tempo was mainly convincing. Outer sections were the most colourful and musically presented, and you caught the character well overall.  As an overall performance, there was some good stylistic insight and musical statements were generally positive and convincing. Supporting this was a sufficiently assured technical approach so that continuity was positive and contrasts were clear, though this was more consistently the case in the Chen, with more balance and evenness needed within the intricate passagework of the Roxburgh for the narrative to completely convince here. Communication was good, and your presentation of these two very different modern pieces revealed engagement and understanding.  I enjoyed hearing you play and was taken by the distinctly personal approach to the music of your programme. Thank you, and my best wishes for continued success in your piano studies."
lXnkxDrE,13-15,Grade 5 and above,No.2 from 6 Dances in Bulgarian Rhythm,Bela Bartok,Nelze Domluvit!,Leos Janacek,66,"You quickly caught the energy and vigour of the rustic idiom, projecting with conviction at a brisk tempo. The rhythm suffered from unevenness and a more stable underlying sense of metre was needed, with more secure synchronisation between the hands. The changes in dynamic level were carefully graded and the basic rhythmic pattern was in place, though with a need for more clarity and crispness of articulation to bring it greater vitality.  The Janacek conveyed a sense of the haunting mood in the more song-like passages and the changes of pace were well judged. There was a loss of clarity and rhythmic security in the more rapid figures, whilst a more sonorous cantabile tone would have further enriched the more mellow interludes. However the style and structure were well understood in your interpretation.  The programme was calmly presented overall, with sufficient spacing in between items. There was a need at times for more assured rhythmic control and for a more song-like melodic tone, but the contrasting styles were well grasped nonetheless.  There was plenty to enjoy in your performances today - good luck in all your future piano playing!"
laPRZaJK,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella,Agnieszka Lasko,Railroad Blues,David Blackwell,80,"You brought spirit and vitality to the opening of the Tarantella, and a vivid feeling of the piece’s dance style was present. Some of the quaver movement needed to be more evenly managed, and greater tonal consistency was missing in some of the left-hand chords, but you upheld a feeling of direction and impetus throughout.  A weighty feeling of the piece’s mood was communicated in Railroad Blues, with often solid support in the accompaniment. You brought in some effective dynamic contrasts too, though rhythmical precision wasn’t always tight, and a crisper feeling of control was possible, but mostly this was a well-defined account.  You brought effective focus and conviction to your playing, and especially in the Tarantella the energy was compelling. There was space overall for more variety in the phrasing, and rhythmical precision wasn’t fully secure, but the characters of both works were well-differentiated.  Well done on this poised and sensitive presentation!"
lxmjgNoV,7-9,Up to Grade 5,A Song of Erin,Thomas Dunhill,Melody in F,Louis Köhler,70,"There was a legato feel to Song of Erin, with effective balancing of the hands. Although more shaping and musical detail were possible there was a mostly secure rhythmic flow.   Sensitivity of tone was sustained overall in Melody in F and the dynamic terracing came across well although the melodic line might have been more strongly projected. The tempo was cautious however the notes were secure.  There was a clear sense of focus in this performance and a poise in the delivery overall.  Well done on a securely memorised performance."
mAnOWAke,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Study in F,C. A. Loeschhorn,T-Rex Hungry,Sonny Chua,87,"Loeschhorn’s ’Study’ had a lovely sense of elegance, showing a very firm grasp of the musical style, supported by mostly poised rhythms. There was a slight left hand stumble early on and some minor losses of coordination in the minor section, with the right hand melody not always fully apparent in the balance. Otherwise it was well articulated and fluent playing.  Much of the detail was clearly communicated through ’T-Rex Hungry’, the musical idea evidently well grasped. Further aggression in the attack and tone in the louder parts would have enhanced the effect, with scope for even more rhythmic impetus and energy. The final right hand chord could also have had a slightly more sustained quality, but this was otherwise a very accomplished rendition.  Both works were very effectively stylised, with clarity of musical shape and detail a commendable strength. The balance between the hands could have afforded more consistency, particularly in the first piece, with room for a stronger sense of outward projection in your approach also. There was a clear feeling of commitment and personal involvement with the playing though, and overall assurance in the management of the technical elements too.  This was an excellent performance! I particularly enjoyed how well you differentiated each piece, making especially good use of articulation to bring out the contrasting styles. Wishing you all the best for your future musical endeavours, keep performing!"
mPDwZxBr,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Hook's Hornpipe (from Piano Tales for Peter Pan),Nikki Iles,Someone You Loved,"Lewis Capaldi, Benjamin Kohn, Peter Kelleher, Thomas Barnes and Samuel Roman",81,"The spirited tempo suited Hook’s Hornpipe, and despite an occasional rhythmic slip and some variation in pulse between sections, the articulation had buoyancy and the dynamic detail was conveyed. More robust tone in the louder playing would have further animated the narrative, but the ending was emphatic with momentum well sustained.  The melodic line was well voiced in Someone You Loved, and there was a legato fluency with dynamic colour mostly sensitive especially in the softer palette, and the pacing was very persuasively managed.  Assurance in notes and flow was a clear strength in this performance with the contrasting musical characters communicated, more convincingly in the second piece, where there was a stronger sense of involvment and conviction in the playing.  The pacing of Someone You Loved was particularly persuasive - an excellent performance."
mXXOzyqg,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude from English Suite No. 3 in G minor, BWV 808",J.S. Bach,Reverie,Claude Debussy,84,"The Bach was confidently presented with clear fingerwork and assured voicing. Repeated chords could have been more elgant in attack and there was room to develop a wider dynamic palette for the piece as a whole. Excellent characterisation of the differing motifs gave this interest and there was a high level of technical ease throughout.  Expressive playing in the Debussy, this flowed at a suitably dreamy pace. Gentler nuances could have been explored, particularly in the central part and the balance between the hands was not always sensitively controlled in the outer sections. However the melodic lines were beautifully shaped and phrases had appropriate smoothness; the final section was particularly effective.  Both pieces achieved a sense of style and throughout, there was a clear feel for the occasion - evident in the positive presentation from the outset.  I appreciated your commitment to the music and stagecraft. Well done on an excellent performance."
mXylBYro,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Figure Skating,William Gillock,Ticklin' Toes,Florence Price,82,"The elegance of ’Figure Skating’ was realised, with forward flow confident. Not all the tempo instructions were observed, however, and it was possible to capture a bolder point of climax mid-way, though the tone remained natural and unforced, with some fluidity displayed.  ’Ticklin’ Toes’ was approached with energy, and there was plenty of bounce in the touch. Playful rhythms were achieved, but even bolder contrast between the sections of the music was desirable. Although a little more focus was needed at times, the style was grasped. Fine detail in articulation was conveyed, with variation in dynamics featured.  An effective contrast was communicated between the two chosen works, and there were convincing displays of poetry and fluidity. Further detail in the shaping of the phrases was necessary at times, despite this, together with a little more variation between sections to support the larger-scale structure of the music. Vitality was present, nonetheless, with tempo choices well judged, and there was buoyancy in the touch.  This was an accomplished performance, with a lively sense of rhythm supporting both interpretations, and a sensitive touch sculpted some very fine detail in articulation. Congratulations!"
mazlbJYZ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Prelude in C Major,J.S.Bach,Waltz in A minor,Chopin,80,"A graceful flow was adopted in the Bach, with pedalling being tastefully added. There was a sense of the gradual ebb and flow of the tonal levels and for the most part the semiquaver work was even. There was room for more subtle highlighting of key harmonic changes and for further interpretive detail, but it was a calm and controlled account nonetheless.  The Chopin explored some well-judged rubato and the pedaling was cleanly executed. It could have moved forward with a little further intensity at times and there was a brief faltering moment in the middle of the piece. However the phrases were contoured with appropriate elegance and the melodic line was clearly defined through the chordal textures.  The programme was presented with an aura of calmness, allowing time and space in between the items. You played with convincing overall rhythmical security and note accuracy within the limited technical demands of the chosen material. The contrasting styles were sensitively defined, with careful use of rubato and an instinctive feel for the undulations of the phrases, albeit with scope for further depth of expression and tonal colouring. There was a clear sense of musical involvement in the performance nevertheless.  There was much to enjoy in your graceful rendition and I wish you luck as you continue to enjoy exploring the piano repertoire."
mkDrBewA,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Sparkling Splashes & Smooth Water,Barbara Arens,Cloudy Day,Christopher Norton,84,"The Arens sparkled at a lively speed with well-defined accents and mostly crisply articulated staccato chords. The legato sections had some lapses of hand coordination and could have been smoother but the ’rits’ were neatly managed, adding to the contrast of mood.  ’Cloudy Day’ moved along with ease and accuracy. There was a confident use of pedal here and after the neatly bouncing opening section the murky change of timbre came across well. Some blurring of pedal occurred in the final part but real atmosphere was attained.  The pieces were presented with assurance, and the differing styles were captured by attention to articulation detail. Tonal control was occasionally lacking but overall the essence of each piece was conveyed.  I enjoyed the sense of occasion that was created. Well done on some excellent playing."
nAoplGjW,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Lowside Blues,Joanna MacGregor,Prelude in G Minor Op.23 No.5,Rachmaninoff,96,"’Lowside Blues’ was played with real control of musical details, accents particularly well stressed to give rhythmic distinction to the style, and with contrasts of tone in the melody supporting its shape and changing character. Occasionally phrases rushed slightly, but the overall character and swagger of the music was found in this accurate and confident account.  The percussive nature of the Rachmaninoff was apparent from the outset, chords evenly played and with repetitions clearly articulated. Dynamic variation was apparent, although there was scope for even greater exploration of the quieter levels. However, tempo flexibility was controlled, the central section showing expression and tonal definition of melodic interest, and despite occasional moments of rushing, this was an exciting and confident account which saw technical security throughout.  Personal involvement was consistently evident in this impressive performance, the professionalism of the delivery credit-worthy. The contrasts within the pieces were tonally defined and throughout, you played with energy and focus, making it an engaging performance to watch.  Many congratulations on this exceptional performance.  I particularly enjoyed the poise and command you displayed, and wish you all the best for your future musical ventures."
nBraKlAA,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Invention no. 1 in C major BWV772,J.S. Bach,Polonaise in G minor,Chopin,89,"Lines were clean and phrases moved with a sense of direction. Notes were accurate in relation to pitch and the lines were fluent. Hands worked well together, though there was scope to capture the rhythmic energy of the piece with more purpose and determination. Whilst there was room for the performance to be more vibrant, there were some organised contrasts of tone.  The Polonaise in G minor was determined in tone at the start, and the phrases were sculpted and expressive, with the changes of sonority engaging and communicative. The pedal was well controlled, and the tone was largely even and well nourished for the most part. This flowed positively and there was a strong sense of cohesion between the different sections.   This was an assured performance, which was poised and well controlled, on the whole. There was some organised pacing between the pieces and they were well contrasted, with the stylistic characters largely well communicated. Although there was scope for more tonal control in parts, the technical demands of the programme overall were met with positivity.  This performance grew in musical portrayal and character, with the Chopin particularly expressive and well-directed – well done."
nDRxXzyk,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Cloudy Day,Christopher Norton,Sparkling Splashes & Smooth Water,Barbara Arens,77,"The staccato detail was well realised in Cloudy Day and the notes were reliably secure and fluent. The range of softer tones needed more exploration to heighten dynamic contrast overall, alongside more rise and fall in the shaping, but the pedalling was effective and the final phrases sensitively managed.  A positive approach to the Arens, with bright tone for the staccato passages which had good momentum. The legato passages were contrasted although more scope for shaping here and for the pulling back in tempo, but overall the narrative was conveyed.  There was a focus in the playing and musical intent was evident, if more to explore in the expressive potential of Cloudy Day.  Vibrancy of tone was very impactful in the staccato passages of your second piece, where there was a good sense of musical communication."
nLYkoaga,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Waltz in A minor, B. 150, Op. Posth.",F. Chopin,Tarantella in A minor,A. Pieczonka,75,"Use of colour showed a good grasp of the sombre mood in the Chopin, your touch suitably soft. The melody needed further projection in the balance to clearly bring out the phrase structure, with some textural blurring, across the early cadential points for instance. There was opportunity to vary the approach to the main theme each time it returned also, but the notes and overall flow were securely in place.  There was a definite feel for the ’Tarantella’ style in the Pieczonka, conveyed in the well articulated main theme and the lively tempo. That said, the left hand tended to be the stronger voice, and this impacted the balance more notably in the central section. There was some catching of adjacent keys there too, but you still kept it moving and sustained the apt sense of energy.  A genuine sense of involvment and personality was sustained across this performance. The roles of each hand needed further definition to bring out the two contrasting characters more effectively, with the legato playing generally prone to textural blurring. Still both were well paced, a clear understanding of the different musical ideas was communicated.  This was a very good performance! I especially admired the rhythmic character you achieved in both pieces. Going forward, more awareness of textural control would further enhance your playing, and I hope you continue to develop your already well established skill in future performances!"
nLyGkbkG,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Allegretto in C major,Anton Diabel,The Sneaky Business,MarthaMier,70,"Allegretto in C was well judged in tempo and details of articulation were consistent. Quavers in the lower part were sluggish at times, and little of the dynamic variety was included. However, hands often worked efficiently together.   You captured the mysterious character in Sneaky Business, and syncopated figures were energised, if not always absolutely even. The final bars sagged in momentum, and there was room for much more sparkling musical detail overall. However, the style was clearly understood and enjoyed.  This was a consistent and carefully articulated performance, though the first piece began rather abruptly, without a spoken introduction, limiting the sense of outward connection and communication. However, tempo choices were well made and hands generally worked efficiently together.  This was a purposeful and often rhythmic performance, well done."
nQakMNZB,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Minuet and trio (3rd movt from Sonata in D Op.10 No.3,Beethoven,"Nocturne in C#minor ,Op.Posth",Chopin,92,"A sweet tone was created for the melodic line at the start of the Beethoven, and the phrases had sensitive shaping and tapering. The hands were coordinated and balanced and the chords sounded together. Rhythmic outlines remained poised and the account held a clear sense of a style. The Trio provided a clear contrast and there was a little more force and energy here. The technical delivery was assured and the account had a sense of flow and direction.  The opening chords in the Chopin had some depth and the notes were placed together, and provided a suitable opening for the body of the Nocturne. The tempo was suitably steady and restrained and the melodic line had a gentle projection, and a warm and clear tone was created. There were some occasional sudden over emphasised notes but the phrases were sensitively shaped in the main. The ornaments and flourishes were suitably light and well defined, with touches of sparkle in some. A stylish and poised presentation.  The programme was suitably contrasted and the detailing and tonal variations found in each piece were apt for the styles. A little more to refinement would have been welcome at times, but the technical delivery was reliable and assured throughout. The sense of presentation was outward and held an air of authority in this very accomplished and stylish performance. Very well done!"
nWxWwzXB,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Witches and wizards,Christine Donkin,Gavotte in G,G F Handel,80,"You played with sensitivity in Witches and Wizards and the rhythmical control was largely robust, though with scope for a little more evenness in places. More needed to be made of the details of accents and shape, and there was room for more vivid impetus to bring more of the spirited character of the music to the fore, but note accuracy was always reliable, and you concluded with a real sense of poise.  Handel’s Gavotte in G was crisply defined and the rhythms at the opening were firm and well-grounded. As the piece progressed there were moments of slight unevenness, particularly when playing the ornaments, and there was room overall for more characterful projection, but this was largely a well-directed account.    For much of your performance you showed strong technical security and there was commendable consistency of flow and direction achieved. There was scope for more characterful engagement to differentiate both styles and moods, with more variety of shape needed, but clear musical sensitivity was ever-present.  Well done on such focused and committed playing."
naRgDWpb,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Sonata in G,Domenico Cimarosa,Waltz,Edvard Grieg,67,"The Sonata began at a suitable pace and was played with the LH lightly articulated. But for one retake and a little rhythmic imprecision, notes and rhythms were mainly in place but there was room to make much more of the contrasts in dynamics and to give the music a greater sense of energy and buoyancy to bring it to life. Momentum was largely maintained, though, and there was something of the character emerging.  The lively opening tempo and lightly articulated LH established the Waltz character very effectively, and this flowed well at the outset, with some of the RH articulation realised. The various ’rits’ could often have been more carefully graded and there was room to explore the opportunities for dynamic contrast much more fully throughout, with scope to balance the hands more carefully at times, but there were some characterful moments.  Engagement and poise were maintained throughout this performance of two strongly contrasted pieces, although there was room for just a little more stillness between the two. A wider dynamic range would have allowed the two different styles to be more fully characterised, but delivery was controlled overall.  I enjoyed your performance - well done."
nbkpKzrb,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Melody in F,Louis Kohler,Winter,Bernadette Marmion,86,"Bringing poise and control to the Melody in F by Kohler, this was expressive and sensitive. The ritenutos needed slightly more natural integration into the flow, and there was scope for nuanced balance between melody and accompaniment, but this was largely a gently flowing account.   Winter by Marmion evoked the descriptive quality of the music to good effect, and the rhythmic flow was appropriately measured, always maintaining pulse with regularity. There were effective dynamic contrasts achieved, and while yet more expressive subtlety was possible in the phrasing, for the most part this was an intense performance.   Your playing revealed careful control and quiet sensitivity, aligning closely with the styles and moods of both the works. There was scope for more vivid expressive detail at times, but the overall effect was of sensitive insight, and rhythm and note accuracy was fully assured.   Well done on your poised, musical playing!"
nnvPoNkX,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Minuet in G BWV Anh. I| 116,Anon.,T-Rex Hungry from A Day in the Life of a T-Rex,Sonny Chua,70,"You paced the ’Minuet’ effectively, showing a grasp of the musical idiom. The feel for the style would have been enhanced by more precise placement of the individual rhythms, and through more expressive shaping and phrasing overall. A brief stumble in the middle section was well recovered though and the notes were safely in place.  An apt sense of forward drive was sustained through ’T-Rex Hungry’. Tonally it needed more aggression to genuinely communicate the musical idea, with room to bring out the varied detail more clearly too. Nevertheless all of the notes were in place and it remained a fluent account throughout.  This was a committed and focussed performance, your approach admirably determined across the programme. Tidier mangement of rhythm and more expressive detail was needed to bring out the different musical styles more clearly, and give more character to the playing generally. This was partly achieved through some apt articulation, however.  Very good playing! I admire how well you managed the technical demands of your chosen pieces, and I hope you continue your musical journey with a well deserved sense of achievement."
nrXQQeRx,13-15,Up to Grade 5,La tarentelle,J.F.F. Burgmüller,The Village in May,Joe Hisaishi,87,"La Tarentelle was nimble in fingerwork, with a buoyant, rhythmic approach winning through well in this accurate, decisive account. Moments of hurrying and less pristine hand coordination were present, and there was scope to include still more dynamic variety, though it was accurate and purposeful throughout.  The village in May was performed with lots of detail and character. Always accurate and enthusiastic playing, if occasionally less light and rhythmic in the left hand's accompaniment and leaving scope for even greater finesse with phrasing. Its witty, nostalgic charm was well put across, and the best areas sprang to life with charisma.  There was very good stylistic definition and excellent accuracy in both performances. Much was inventive and assertive, with an individual approach coming forward especially well during the Hisaishi piece.  Many congratulations, and very best wishes for your onward musical jouirney!"
nvLDYLOk,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Scherzino,Moszkowski,Girl With The Flaxen Hair,Debussy,89,"In the Scherzino there was crisp and vital articulation at an appropriately energetic tempo. A minor note deviation or two surfaced but the contrast of character in the more lyrical passage was eloquently marked. Here the melodic line sang out plaintively above the accompanying textures and the pedalling was effectively integrated, with phrases being tastefully contoured. The closing phase of the piece saw a return to the opening verve, albeit with the occasional chordal ’splash’ occurring. It was a vibrant and colourful account nonetheless.  The Debussy was played with sensitivity both in its carefully shaped phrases and in its imaginative deployment of rubato. The melodic themes were clearly highlighted and the chords were tidily synchronised. There was a bar of crotchet figures close to the end which were played in double tempo but elsewhere it was an accurate account, which showed tenderness in its use of tone colours.  The programme was presented in a calm and professional style, if needing a little more stillness and poise at the end of the first piece before continuing. The technical demands of the works chosen were mostly well met, with just occasional small note deviations in more challenging passagework and one moment of rhythmical misjudgement in the Debussy. However, melodic lines were confidently highlighted and the pedalling was subtly integrated into the textures. The contrasting moods and styles were conveyed with instinctive grace and sensitivity, the dynamic colours being intelligently chosen. The performance as a whole showed both imagination and musical commitment.  There was much to enjoy in your work today - well done and I wish you the best of luck in all your future musical endeavours!"
nwvogkjE,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Railroad blues,David blackwell,Always with me,Youmi kimura,65,"Railroad Blues was brisk in tempo, with the heavy LH chords capturing the style very effectively at the outset. The RH figures were colourfully contrasted in dynamics creating a call and response effect which brought the music to life. Not all was completely secure, with a couple of cautious moments when mometum was briefly lost, and the tempo was not always consistenly maintained, with the ending rather too drawn out, but this was a characterful account overall.  Always with Me was melodically accurate overall, although there were several stumbles towards the end, when momentum was lost, and the opening tempo was apt. The pace fluctuated considerably as the piece went on, though, with the meter sometimes obscured, and there was room to shape and colour the phrases much more fully. The sustaining pedal warmed the tone in the second section, although the texture was sometimes rather too blurred. The ending was sensitively managed.  Engagement and commitment were present throughout this performance, with poise maintained, although a little more stillness between the two very contrasting pieces would have helped to establish the different styles. Delivery was compromised by melodic and rhythmic errors, and instablity in tempi, but there were some characterful moments in your playing, particularly in the first half of the performance.  I enjoyed your playing - well done."
nzQokKxY,13-15,Grade 5 and above,AIR VARIE - OP. 16 NO.12,Samuel Maykapar,SONATINA In C MAJOR - First Movement OP.93,Aram Kachaturian,87,"There was a sense of controlled, focused delivery throughout the Maykapar, and very secure notes and rhythms supported this. Tempo choices were positive and phrases had purposeful direction. Dynamic contrasts were quite narrow in scope at times, within variations, and there was room for more overt change between phrases, though well controlled and insightful rubato framed each section and allowed cadences to be poised. The minor variation was slower than the marked tempo, and though this afforded room for quite lyrical playing, it altered the character of this section. There was a further significant tempo anomaly in the coda, where momentum was lost. Elsewhere, this was characterful playing with plenty of boldness and stylistic awareness.  The energy of the Sonatina was conveyed in a very well projected and boldly articulated account, with accurate notes in place. Some tempo-related instructions were overlooked, such as the poco animato bar which was played with a significant rallentando. This affected the character of the music but nonetheless the playing was often cohesive, arresting and always colourful, with sustained pulse and singular, bold expressive statements.  As a performance, this was engaging and individual, with plenty of colour and contrast supported by assured technical delivery. Interpretative decisions, particularly around tempo, needed to be more in line with the demands of the music in order to preserve character. There was otherwise positive and often energetic, focused and adept playing.  Thank you for sharing your very assured and clearly engaged musical work! It was very enjoyable to hear, and I wish you continued success in your piano studies."
oBmkkmYw,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Minuet in G BWV Anh. I| 116,Anon.,The Song of Twilight from Piano Pieces for Children,Yoshinao Nakada,73,"You found all of the notes assuredly through the 'Jester's Jig', and with a suitably even touch in the first half, giving a smooth legato. Rhythmically it needed further energy for a more vivid sense of character, with scope to direct and sculpt the phrasing more expressively throughout. It was an entirely fluent account, nonetheless.   A legato approach showed a grasp of the musical mood in 'Wind in the Willows'. The pedalling could have been more refined, the texture was sometimes blurred across harmonic progressions, notably in the final bars. The melody generally needed more expressive contouring and clearer projection, but the notes were safely in place and the tempo was apt.   Your approach was fully focussed throughout the programme, showing a clear commitment to the performance. The expressive elements of both pieces could have been more effectively communicated on the whole, but their technical demands were assuredly met.   Very good playing! You demonstrated solid control and accuracy through both of your chosen works, and approached the performance with an admirable degree of personal conviction. I hope you go forwards with a well earned sense of confidence."
oJXbzVqG,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Hook’s Hornpipe,Nikki lles,Big City Blues,Nancy Faber,66,"Hook’s Hornpipe began confidently at a lively pace, with notes in place and a sense of rhythmic energy. The opening precision in rhythm was not maintained, though, with a number of errors and the tempo slowing considerably after the first section, with a couple of retakes and the meter not always clearly established. The sustaining pedal warmed the tone at times and some dynamic contrast added colour, with elements of the character conveyed overall.  A bold opening established the character of Big City Blues and this was taken at a suitable tempo. Notes and rhythms were largely in place although some of the upbeat quavers could have been shorter to maintain the swung feel, which was not fully established on the return of the opening material. More could have been made of the contrasts in dynamics, notably in the middle section and not all was completely secure rhythmically in the final bars, but the style was largely grasped in this positive account.  Poise and engagement were maintained throughout this performance, which was effectively paced. Greater precision in delivery would have helped to differentiate the styles of these two rhythmic pieces, but there was some colour and contrast, with effectively expressed moments.  A good performance - well done."
oLglGezP,16-18,Grade 5 and above,New Kid No. 9 from The Christopher Norton Jazz Preludes Collection,Christopher Norton,Reverie,Debussy,76,"A bright and lively tempo was adopted at the start of ’New Kid’, and the rhythmic patterns were precise and defined. There were clear signs of buoyancy and energy and the fingerwork was well defined. There were a couple of stumbles en route and also a little rhythmic instability, but the line was maintained and the jazz style character was conveyed.  A soft and warm tone was created at the start of the Debussy and the account held a relaxed and fluid sense of flow. There were some missed notes on occasion but the hands were well balanced and mostly well coordinated, though the chords did not always sound together in the middle section. Even greater tonal variation could have been explored and there was some technical instability towards the end. The dreamy expressive style was effectively communicated though.  The playing was outward and communicative throughout and the contrasting styles were well realised. There were technical mishaps in both accounts but there were clear signs of musical awareness and instrument management. A very good and engaging performance, well done!"
oNDzZOLg,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Toccata,Martin Cuellar,Rondo in A,Joseph Myslivecek,78,"The spirit of a Toccata was definitely captured in the Cuellar, your approach suitably energetic and admirably robust in the louder moments. Rhythmcially it needed more tidy control though, the fingerwork was not reliably even and this impacted the faster playing that made up the majority of the work. In the more lyrical passages, both the legato and balance could have been further refined, but the musical mood was well contrasted, and the notes were assured throughout.  Myslivecek’s ’Rondo’ had an apt sense of elegance to begin, with clear shaping and musical contrasts both strong features as it developed. Louder moments were less stylish in effect, the touch in the right hand tending to be quite firm. Faster moving rhythms were not consistently well placed or coordinated, but it was fluent playing overall and the character of the music still came through clearly.  Two very different styles of music were well communicated through this performance, their varied characteristics clearly understood. More control of rapidly moving passages and of tonal awarness was needed to bring further musical clarity, and a more vivid sense of character to each. Scope for more personal stillness as both pieces concluded remained too; this would have allowed the music to embed more effectively, but there was always an admirable sense of engagement with the playing.  Very good playing! This engaging performance showcased your enthusiasm, and your versatile musical knowledge and skill, and I hope you continue to share these laudable talents with others in future performances!"
odmZXaMy,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Minuet in G,Anon,The Song of Twilight,Yoshinao Nakada,85,"The tempo was well chosen for the ’Minuet’, with the elegance of this courtly dance sensed. Further detail and shape were possible in the phrasing, however, together with a little more focus at times. Some contrast between the sections was realised, nonetheless, with the smooth grading of the slowing tempo at the end controlled, and the light touch suited this period of music.  ’Twilight’ captured delicate colours, and the necessary calm was realised. Bolder shaping of the long phrases was desirable, despite this, and some of the left hand chords were slightly split in sound. It was possible for the melody to sing with greater expression, but sensitivity was apparent. A clear tone prevailed, with forward flow confident.  There were displays of fluidity, as well as some poetry, in these two interpretations, and co-ordination proved secure, with a good range of articulation explored. Even bolder changes in colour and mood were possible, however, together with a little more expression and conviction in the shaping of phrases and melodies, but the tone was never harsh or forced and this retained clarity during softer dynamics. Buoyancy was displayed, and there was well-judged use of the pedal, with good command over changing tempi.  You are an accomplished young performer, able to communicate true vitality and finesse. Congratulations on these interpretations!"
ojOrMVzW,13-15,Up to Grade 5,March in D major BWV Anh.122,CPE Bach,To a Wild Rose Op.51 No.1,Edward MacDowell,85,"The Bach was well articulated, a buoyant approach giving a firm sense of style to the playing. A little more momentum would have brought out the ’March’ character more convincingly, with slight catching of adjacent keys midway. It was neatly rhythmic and well coordinated otherwise.  Legato playing was often well managed in ’To a Wild Rose’, the pedalling well controlled, adding apt colour. A more sensitive touch in the louder moments would have given it further warmth, with room to manage the left hand chords more subtly in this regard too. It was clearly shaped though and entirely fluent, just leaving room for even more expressive rhythmic poise.  This was a characterful performance which demonstrated a clear understanding of different musical styles, both pieces well articulated and entirely fluent. Further refinement of tonal sensitivity and rhythmic nuance would have given an even more vivid effect to the performance, as would a little more personal poise at the end of the Bach. Nonetheless, you were evidently engaged with the music and fully committed.  Excellent playing! I particularly enjoyed your colourful rendition of ’To a Wild Rose’, and hope you continue your musical journey with a well earned sense of confidence."
oqWBMvrX,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Allegro, First movement from Sonatina in C, Op 20 No.1",Friedrich Kuhlau,"Val’s poético, No.6 from Valses poéticos",Enrique Granados,79,"The Kuhlau flowed carefully, with a warm tone and projected melody. Parts were coordinated neatly, with mainly rhythmic and fluid semiquavers; the pulse slightly slowed as it progressed, particuarly through quick passages - though recovered at the return of the main melody. One small blemish was not disruptive; scope for more assured direction and varied articulation - and wider dynamic range, though there was some careful shaping. Overall there was reliable accuracy and fluidity here.  The Granados had a sustained legato melody and stylistic momentum - though accompanying chords were often rather overpowering. This flowed reliably, with some effective musical flexibility, though hesitations between phrases were slightly unsettling. Accompanying quavers in the final section were fluid, though needed more forward direction; room for wider dynamic range overall, but the expressive mood was captured.  This was a fluent performance, with effective transitions between styles, and some careful musical details. The tone had warmth, but dynamic range was often limited; parts needed more careful balancing at times, but technical details were secure, with reliable continuity overall.  I particularly enjoyed the characterful sensitivity you conveyed in the Granados."
ovwNvmAm,13-15,Up to Grade 5,In the time of a waltz,Louise Farrenc,Billie’s Song,Valerie Capers,68,"The Farrenc began carefully, with rhythmic melodic semiquavers and neatly placed chords. A few unrhythmic and hesitant moments were sometimes unsettling, with the pulse not always consistently maintained. Parts were coordinated at first, but there was some untidiness, increasingly towards the end. Overall this was fluent, with light staccato and lyrical shaping through phrases.    ’Billie’s Song’ had a warm tone and fluid legato melody, with some dynamic shaping - though room for much quieter playing at times. The tempo was rather cautious, with more focused melodic direction needed throughout. A few blemishes and unsteady rhythms did not disrupt momentum, and overall this was fluent, with chords neatly placed, and the expressive mood captured.    The performance was fluent, with successful pacing between pieces and different musical styles approached sensitively. Slips and untidy moments were mainly not disruptive, and there was reliable continuity overall.    Your stylistic phrasing and light articulation in the Farrenc effectively conveyed the graceful mood of the piece."
pElXPmqG,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Allegro Assai, 3rd movement from Sonata in G",Georg Benda,Wallace and Gromit Theme,"Julian Nott, arr. L'Estrange",78,"The Allegro Assai flowed well from the outset at a brisk tempo, with the semiquaver scale figures passing seamlessly between the hands at the outset and a sense of energy established. The tempo was not always consistently maintained, particuarly in the second half of the piece, and there was one retake, but notes and rhythms were otherwise in place with some dynamic contrast adding colour.  The crisply detached LH captured the style of the Wallace and Gromit Theme from the outset, and the tempo was well chosen. But for a couple of rhythmically insecure moments, all was in place in this buoyant performance, with just room for bolder dynamic contrasts and greater projection of some of the LH melodic lines. A characterful and spirited account.  This was a committed and engaging performance, with poise maintained throughout, and some effective communication and projection. Clarity of articulation was a consistent strength and helped to characterise the two contrasting styles. But for a few rhythmic imprecisions and tempo fluctuations, all was controlled and accurate.  A very good performance - well done!"
pRmlQjRZ,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Melody in F,Louis Kohler,Berry's Smoothie,Nikki Yeoh,81,"Melody in F flowed smoothly and gently, and you provided reliable consistency of flow at the start, just needing a little more control and evenness as the piece unfolded. Not all the notes sounded fully, leaving some gaps in the texture in the second half, and there was scope for better balance between theme and accompaniment, but note accuracy was always guaranteed.  Berry’s Smoothie by contrast was vibrant and alert, and the opening of the piece was particularly vivid and well-controlled. Latterly there was room for a little more precision in the rhythms and the flow became slightly bumpy on occasion, but you concluded with a good sense of flair.  A positive feeling of performance awareness, coupled with stylish differentiation of the two works were commendably achieved, and there was confidence communicated in your playing. The phrasing would have benefited from more variety to complete the interpretations, and the rhythmical control wasn’t fully even, but the notes were all reliably placed, and this was characterful playing.  Well done on such a focused and committed performance"
pVrXKMNX,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Clown,Dmitry Kabalevsky,Starlight,Martha Mier,73,"A clear tone, with bounce in the touch displayed. It was possible to shape the phrases with further rhythmic playfulness and spontaneity to fully capture the character of the clown, however, and a few uneven figures were audible. Even though the approach was a little too one-coloured, with bolder shapes and more energy necessary, the pulse retained clarity, with articulation varied.  The tempo was well chosen in ’Starlight’, and touches of pedal added dimension to the sounds. The melody needed to sing with further expression and poetry, despite this, with a small hesitation present at one point. Repeated patterns and phrases required more shape and variation, with the pulse a little over-emphasised at times, but flow was displayed, and the mood was mostly calm which suited the nocturnal setting.  Legato playing was achieved, with some buoyancy realised in the touch. Even so, much more vigour and colour were necessary in the first piece to provide important contrast between the two chosen works, and technical control was not always complete. Melodies needed to sing with further expression, and deeper engagement in the music and subject matter was required. Tempo choices proved reliable, nonetheless, with forward flow and detailed articulation displayed.  Your playing captured a bright, clear tone, and awareness of the pulse remained constant. Continue to enjoy exploring the wonderful world of the piano!"
pdvjjlXQ,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Arabesque,Friedrich Burgmuller,Autumn Leaves,Joseph Kosma,79,"A lively tempo and mood were established at the start of the 'Arabesque', and there was bounce in the touch. Uneven fast figures were audible, however, and there was room for further detail, as well as a little more focus. The ending sounded brilliant and exciting, nonetheless, with vitality present.  Use of the pedal enhanced the warmth of the sounds, and both thoughtfulness and sensitivity were conveyed in 'Autumn Leaves'. Even more flexibility and colour were possible, despite this, together with bolder contrast between the sections of the music. Although the melody needed to sing with further conviction, as well as a smoother touch in places, a wide range of dynamics was explored. Forward flow remained confident, with some fine detail achieved.  Some engagement in the music was displayed, with contrasting moods between the two pieces realised. There was room for a little more technical control and focus to support playing of even greater conviction, though a lively musicality prevailed, with tempo choices well judged.   You captured moments of brilliance and poetry in these two interpretations. This was a most enjoyable performance. Well done!"
plmNBDVZ,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Romanze in F# Op 28,Robert Schumann,Arabesque No 2,Claude Debussy,88,"The Schumann was performed with sincerity in the sonorously-projected melodic lines. There was a warmth of tone, albeit with small smudges of harmony appearing in the pedalling. It needed more forward movement at times to add to the intensity and sense of direction but you shaped the phrases with grace and the rubato was expressively integrated.  The Arabesque bounced along at a brisk pace, with phrases being purposefully directed. There was room for still more incisive articulation and the odd note blemish or loss of tonal clarity surfaced, but you provided a broad range of colours and highlighted the key structural ’corners’ of the music with care. Occasionally the composer’s dynamic indications needed to be a little more faithfully adhered to but the quirky character of the writing was effectively portrayed nevertheless.  You presented the programme in a calm and well-poised manner, allowing appropriate space in between items. Despite the occasional technical deviation, the stylistic contrasts were convincingly executed and you brought a good deal of colour and interpretive detail to your performance.  There was much to enjoy in your excellent work and I wish you the very best of luck in all your future piano playing exploits!"
qExWpAvN,10-12,Up to Grade 5,SINCERITY,BURGMULLER,GAVOTTE IN F,J. L. DUSSEK,71,"The Burgmuller unfolded gently with some elegant phrasing. The hands were sensitively balanced at the outset although the left hand became more intrusive later on. There could have been more flow overall, with the lines becoming stuck towards the end but the melody had a clear sesne of projection.  The Gavotte opened boldly and was played with firm rhythmic direction. A lighter touch could have been developed in the left hand and there was room to make the dynamic shaping clearer. All securely conveyed though with a good feel for the underlying dance patterns.  This was a calm performance which attained some variety of mood and energy. Further detail could have been explored in each hand but the overall presentation created the essence of the pieces.  I enjoyed the focus and communicative spirit of this programme. Well done."
qJavRvBb,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Sparkling Splashes & Smooth Water (from The Mermaid Challenge),Barbara Arens,Cloudy Day (No. 9 from Microjazz Collection 2),Christopher Norton,72,"Sparkling Splashes and Smooth Water began confidently at a lively tempo, and was rhythmically played at the outset, with the accents well pointed. The tempo slowed a little at the start of the legato sections and there was scope to make more of the changes in dynamic here, but the ’rits’ were well managed and the articulation was colourfully contrasted.  Cloudy Day was crisply articulated in the RH at the outset and flowed well, despite a little unevenness in the shorter notes at times. There was scope to make much more of the opportunities to contrast the dynamics, notably in the second half of the piece, but the sustaing pedal warmed the tone and there was somthing of the character conveyed overall.  Commitment and poise were maintained until the last note of the performance, although waiting until the final chord had stopped resonating before getting up from the piano stool would have allowed for a more reflective end to the performance. There was room for a stronger sense of communication throughout, but contrasts in tempo and articulation helped to differentiate the characters of the two pieces.  I enjoyed your performance of these two engaging pieces."
qONKxnLW,7-9,Grade 5 and above,ETUDE ALLEGRO,YOSHINAO NAKADA,NO.6 FROM VALSES POETICO,ENRIQUE GRANADOS,78,"The Etude Allegro saw appropriate vivacity, and the wider dynamic contrasts were found, the central section in particular showing musical shaping of the melodic line.  There was scope for further tonal variation in the faster chordal passages, where hand alternation was not consistently even, although the sense of excitement in these passages was maintained, and although further attendance to the quieter dynamic levels would have enhanced the overall character of the music, this was an accurate account.  The tempo flexibility used in the Granados was appropriate to the style, and textural voicing allowed the melody to sing for the majority.  More use of the quieter dynamic levels would have enhanced the sentimentality, with repeated notes in the melody in particular needing greater tonal control.  However, musical expression was apparent, and the account saw overall accuracy and a good degree of harmonic clarity, the legato well controlled.  This was a confident performance overall, the contrasting styles defined and with appropriate time and poise apparent in their transition.  Musical shaping was apparent, although greater tonal nuance and use of the quieter levels would have heightened the overall delivery, despite its accuracy and engagement.    Well done on the energy of your performance.  I particularly enjoyed the enthusiasm with which you played the first piece."
qYeGedvA,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Romance,Dario Sciarra,"Rondo (2nd Movement from Sonatina in A Major, op. 59 no. 1)",Friedrich Kuhlau,84,"Romance demonstrated a clear sense of expressive personality at a well chosen tempo. The tone had freedom, if not full incisiveness - an occasional non-sounding note occurred at the quieter end of the dynamic range. Rubato occasionally became somewhat less effective within the wider context of the piece, though the agitated central section took on welcome verve and individuality.  The Kuhlau performance had the advantage of accuracy and a driven tempo. Not all was as clearly synchronised or even in delivery, with semiquaver patterns calling for extra consistency. Repeated notes worked well, with the music’s infectious character firmly interpreted, and there were passages of excellent wit and liveliness to commend.  The two performances were imaginatively presented and paced, showing excellent accuracy and imagination. While there were areas of less consistent instrumental control and precision, musical details were often enthusiastically and musically embraced.  Well done, and very best wishes for your onward musical journey!"
qaPRBadY,10-12,Up to Grade 5,MOON RIVER,HENRY MANCINI,RUSHING RIVER,MELODY BOBER & GLORI GORANSON,67,"Moon River was expressively conveyed at a thoughtful pace. The melody was smooth but there was scope to make the phrases longer in shape and develop the dynamic structure, whilst the left hand was often intruding and occasionally uneven. The sound was just right though, it’s gentle projection suiting the mood of the piece.  Rushing River had an appropriately bright momentum and flowed forwards with confidence. The chords could have been more horizontal in projection, becoming somewhat heavy in attack but there was a feel for the dramatic range of the piece in these. Overall, a bolder dynamnic landscape could have been explored to enhance the secure playing.  A little more time could have been taken between the pieces but overall the execution had control.  I enjoyed the contrast in character between the rivers. Well done on some good playing."
qaPpEwgW,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Jazz Exercise No. 2,Oscar Peterson,Nocturne C sharp minor No. 20,Chopin,82,"The Jazz piece was played at a steady pace and the pulse was well maintained. Rhythmic patterns were precise and defined and the detailing was carefully, and effectively observed. Rather more buoyancy and colour could have been found but the technical delivery was reliable and the style was well realised.  The opening chords in the Chopin were not quite placed together but there was depth in the tone and the notes were secure. The melodic line was suitably projected over the accompaniment in the body of the piece, and a sweet tone was created. The phrases were expressive and contoured and some of the flourishes were bright and crystalline. There was some hesitation and rhythmic and ease as the account progressed, and also some slips in the notes. There was some hesitation and rhythmic unease as the account progressed, and also some slips in the notes. However, the tempo was suitably steady and restrained, especially in the slower endings.  The sense of performance was outward and the contrasting styles were effectively portrayed. There was a little rhythmic uncertainty in both pieces but the playing showed technical facility and agility in the fingerwork. The programme was fittingly contrasted and showed excellent performance skills. Very well done!"
qgXerZZJ,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Tempo di minuetto,Marianne von Martinez,Prelude: Twilight Op. 69,D. G. Rahbee,74,"The first piece began at a lively pace and had a sense of flow and direction. The quicker semiquaver passages were mostly well defined, but were not always quite even and a little more breathing space between the phrases would have been welcome. The tempo was not fully consistent and there were occasional missed notes. Rather more shaping and tapering could have been found but the line was maintained, and something of the style was conveyed.    There was evidence of tonal depth in the bass line, and the melodic line was given projection in Twilight. There was some blurring in the sound as the pedal was not fully lifted, and the legato phrases could have had more subtle shaping and tapering. The line had a sense of flow however, and there were touches of tonal variation and dynamic colour to describe the tranquil scene.    An even greater sense of musical communication could have been found but the contrasting styles were evident and something of the atmosphere was created in Twilight. The introduction was clear and the programme well paced, and showed performance awareness. Well done on your playing."
qjgdaOeg,10-12,Up to Grade 5,WALLACE AND GROMIT THEME,JULIAN NOTT,"A Little Joke, from Thirty Children's Pieces, Op. 27, No. 13",KABALEVSKY,84,"The Wallace and Gromit Theme opened with a well-balanced melodic line and phrases which moved with a sense of direction. The overall pulse was not always robust, and there was scope for tighter rhythmic control in parts. The notes were largely secure, and whilst the rhythmic energy of the piece needed to be more crisp and purposeful, the tone remained clean and there were some organised and effective dynamic contrasts.  The second piece was metrical, crisp and the demisemiquavers were precise and sprightly. Articulation was purposeful and the Vivace marking was well captured. Whilst there was some contouring of the phrases, there was room to make more of the dynamic shaping and to explore a wider range of tonal colours. The performance itself though was playful and poised.  Lines were clearly projected throughout, with the textures well managed. There was a clear sense of involvement conveyed, and the different musical identities of the pieces came across in part. There was room for the performances to be even more vibrant and expressive, and for greater contrast between the items. Although there needed to be tighter control of the pulse in the first piece, the second was tight and well driven, with the technical demands of the programme overall, largely met with positivity.  I particularly enjoyed the energy and clarity of the second piece - well done!"
qlpKOrOx,10-12,Grade 5 and above,View From A Window,Ben Crosland,Tarentelle,Moritz Moszkowski,95,The View from a Window was expressively conveyed from the outset with sensitively built lines and beautifully crafted phrases. Voicing was natural and the flexible pulse allowed the music's essence to come across throughout.   Assured technical command enabled the Tarentella to dance forwards with characterful ease. There was occasional harshness of sound on some of the accented chords but otherwise tonal gradation was well-judged. A wide array of dynamic contrasts and colours added to the vital rhythmic impulse of this compelling account.   This was outstanding playing which was presented with musical confidence and neat stagecraft. The style of each piece was vividly apparent and control of the instrument was always in place.  I enjoyed this high level performance which showed maturity and flair.
qplvLGOd,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Galop Final,Alfredo Casella,Nocturne,"Written by Laufey, arranged by Ted Case",83,"A brisk galop was established and there was crisp and buoyant articulation. A degree of unevenness surfaced in the running semiquavers and the occasional note slip appeared but the sprightly pace and well varied tone colours gave rise to a characterful account, with the changes of tempo being effectively gauged.  The darker mood of the Nocturne was successfully captured, with graceful swells in tone being provided. The melodic lines needed to penetrate more sonorously through the textures and the harmonies became a little over-clouded in the pedalling. Whilst there was room for a more full-blooded tonal range, it was nevertheless thoughtfully shaped, with the rubato being sensitively integrated.  You presented the programme with an appropriate sense of poise, allowing suitable breathing space in between the two items. The technical element of the work was mostly assured, with just the odd note diversion or chordal slip encroaching. The contrasting musical styles were well realised, with some energetic and characterful playing in the Galop and thoughtful expressive shaping in the Nocturne, albeit with a need for further richness of melodic tone and room for still more vivid dynamic colouring. The performance was nevertheless musically persuasive and committed.  Some expressive and enjoyable piano playing - good luck in all your future performing!"
qwwNmyrw,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Allegro in F,Mozart,Doucie Amie,Melanie Bonis,76,"The Mozart had a rhythmic melody, with reliable clarity in most flourishes. Parts were coordinated, with some stylistic light phrasing - though not consistently maintained. There was some musical and dynamic shaping, but the melodic line needed more fluid legato, with moments of untidiness and hesitancy in quieter playing; overall this was fluent and characterful.  The Bonis began with a steady pulse and careful rhythmic chords - though these were not always neatly placed. The melody had clear legato flow, with some lyrical and dynamic shaping. A few errors and hesitations were slightly unsettling, with moments of untidiness and unsteady pulse, particuarly towards the end; overall this flowed reliably.  This was a generally fluent performance, with some stylistic phrasing and momentum - and dynamic shaping. Technical details were mostly reliable, though there were slips and untidy moments, and occasionally unsteady pulse. Overall this was secure, with some thoughtful musical details.  I particularly liked your stylistic light staccato at the start of the Mozart."
qxmWZAgX,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Nocturne Opus 9 No. 2,Frederic Chopin,Prelude Twilight Op. 69,D.G. Rahbee,78,"The Chopin was well paced, with gentle, supportive left hand patterns to underpin the melodic line. Shaping was evident, with some moments of poignant calmness. Tone was largely well controlled and there was balance between the hands. Pedal sometimes intruded on the texture, and there needed to be more commitment to the sense of line, with blemishes causing moments of less even delivery, particularly in the decorative patterns and with some of the rhythmic coordination. There were some fleeting splashes in the chords and the coda was affected by inconsistent projection, but the general ebb and flow of this lyrical piece was understood and well communicated.  There was evident understanding of the melodic contour and expressive scope of the Rahbee, with clear dynamic variation supporting the rise and fall of the melodic line. The left hand supported this with a sense of flow, despite some unsteady projection and coordination, and occasional uneasy pedalling. The tempo was kept positive and there was expressive flexibility at the end particularly, but scope to find even greater conviction in the tone and shape to communicate the lyrical qualities of the music. Notes were secure, and pulse was stable and well controlled throughout.  Your performance of these two pieces - each lyrical and expressive within its own style - revealed engagement with the mood and character of the music. This was generally well communicated to the listener, but there was some caution and reservation in terms of expressive breadth, and coordination of tone and rhythm was not always fully stable. Pacing was performance-aware and suited the repertoire well, and the playing was focused throughout, with accuracy and continuity.  Thank you for sharing your playing. These two pieces were expressively presented and enjoyable to listen to. I wish you well in your continued piano studies."
rEPlyWNV,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Minnie Mouse Hits Town,Pam Wedgwood,"At Home op.134, No.6",Heinrich Lichner,75,"’Minnie Mouse hits Town!’ realised a clear, full-bodied tone, and there was some bounce in the touch. The playing was rather one-coloured, however, with further shape and expression required. Contrast between the sections of the music, as well as variation between repeated material, were limited, but energy was present, with some of the playful syncopation captured.  A lively mood was explored from the start in ’At Home’, with articulation varied. A wider range of colour and expression needed to find a voice, despite this, and the accompaniment often sounded too dominant and lacking in variation. Buoyancy was present, nonetheless, with both rhythmic vigour and vitality communicated.  Both pieces were approached with energy, and there was constant awareness of the pulse, with the slowing of tempo well graded in the first item. Even so, deeper engagement in the music was necessary, with contrast in colour and mood, as well as dynamic variety, often restricted. Although melodies needed to sing with greater expression, with further detail and shape desirable, bouncy rhythms were realised. The tone proved reliable, with forward flow confidently sustained.  This was a lively presentation, full of vigour and energy, with the closing chords bright and decisive. Well done!"
rEbnRJWv,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Piano Sonata K.309,Domenico Scarlatti,Thunder in drought season,Chen Peixun,86,"Scarlatti’s Sonata found an apt sense of elegance, with clear phrasing and varied articulation both admirable strengths. It was generally a little less poised as it developed, with the right hand quavers not always as neatly placed as was possible. A more sustained quality in the left hand minims near the end would have enhanced the harmonic effect, but this was still a stylish and assured rendition.   A range of colour and musical nuance characterised ’Thunder in Drought Season’ very effectively, with the melodic line well projected overall, if a little less so when it was more chordal in texture. Further sonority in the upper range of the final moments, and more consistent clarity of phrasing, would have given it a more vivid sense of experssion still. Regardless, the rhythms were nimbly managed and it was assured in approach throughout.   Personal engagement with the music was apparent across the programme, leaving room only for even more poise as each work concluded. Phrasing and neatness of rhythmic control could have been more consistent, but this was a well executed performance overall.   This was an engaging, individual performance which showed a firm understanding of both musical styles. I particularly enjoyed your rendition of ’Thunder in Drought Season’, where you made excellent use of tonal colour and dexterous fingerwork to communicate the musical idea. I hope you enjoy many future performances!"
rJdNAvAM,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Le Cou Cou,Louis-Claude Daquin,Tribute to Roberto Garcia Morillo,Ginastera,87,"A lively pace and neatly managed semiquavers captured the character of Daquin’s ’Le Coucou’ well, with a nice balance between the hands also achieved. In terms of shaping and phrasing it could have been still more imaginative, especially each time the main theme returned. A couple of the cadential points were less rhythmically placed and could have afforded more poise, but it was fluent and well articulated playing nonetheless.   There was a convincing sense of drive and forward impulse in the Gianastra, leaving room to find an even more energetic pace. Fingerwork in the right hand tended to be less neat in the arpeggiated parts, with a broader range of tonal projection and attack needed to bring out the style of the piece more convincingly. Still the notes were largely secure, as was the overall flow, with suitable aggression in the approach at the end.   An engaging, individual performance, with particularly effective personal poise at the end of each piece, allowing the music to embed. The Gianastra was generally less persuasive in terms of both characterisation and control, but a good grasp of the different musical moods of each piece was still communicated.   Bravo! An excellent and enthusiastic performance. I sincerely hope you continue to share your obvious passion for music with others, and wish you ongoing success in your future performances."

Burgmuller,The Village in May,Joe Hisaishi,69,"’La Tarentelle’ began carefully, with coordinated parts; the tempo was cautious at first, but quickened with more assurance in the main melody. Crisp, characterful phrasing here; increasing untidiness between hands, but staccato chords in the middle were rhythmic. There was mostly reliable momentum, apart from hesitancy towards the end; scope for more varied dynamics, but this was fluent overall.  ’The Village in May’ opened cheerfully, with light phrasing and a solid bass line. Melodic passages were secure and rhythmic at first, but this became increasingly uncertain, with hesitancy and slips - and often wavering pulse. Much more dynamic variety was needed overall, but this concluded with some characterful energy.  This was a generally reliable performance, with some stylistic details and phrasing - though dynamic range was rather limited. Technical details were partially secure, but there were often errors and untidy, hesitant moments, particularly in the second piece; overall this was fluid with some characterful momentum.  I particularly liked the light cheerfulness you conveyed in the opening of the Hisaishi."

Fleeting untidiness sometimes unsteadied the pulse at ends of phrases, and where hands played in unison, with some blemishes and rushed moments later. Scope for more tonal variety and dynamic shaping, particularly through sequential passages. Overall this was fluent, with stylistic phrasing and bold musical energy.   'Jazz Fantasy on Mozart' began with characterful phrasing and crisp clarity in semiquavers, with hands neatly coordinated. Assured control was maintained through extended quick passages, with effective transitions between rhythm patterns. Consistent musical focus throughout, but there were moments of hurrying and untidiness later on particularly, with blemishes - though momentum was unaffected. Scope for more time for the music to 'breathe', and for much wider dynamic and tonal range - though some ’echo’ dynamics were effective. Overall there was stylistic assurance here.   This was a confident performance, with mainly reliable control throughout - small blemishes were not disruptive. Different musical styles were effectively communicated, with attentive musical details and carefully projected melodic lines. Scope for more tonal and dynamic variety, but this was musically presented.   I particularly admired the rhythmic clarity and control you achieved in 'Jazz Fantasy'."

Bach,Kabalevsky Sonatina No. 1 Op13 for Piano,Dmitri Kabalevsky,84,"Bach’s Invention was expressive in shape, and hands worked together with a clear feeling of unity. There was occasional unevenness of faster notes and room for further consideration of balance at times. However, the conversational style was well understood.   The Kabalevsky provided an immediate change of character, and details of articulation were initially vibrant. There was plenty of energy in the rhythmic approach, despite moments of unevenness, and some of the dynamic colour was really decisive. The end was especially effective.  This was a musically shaped performance, with a good grasp of the contrasting styles. Space before the first piece was rather limited, with little time for reflective preparation, but this was rectified before the Kabalevsky. Even more refined detail was possible, but expressive ideas were often clearly delivered.  Congratulations on an excellent performance, and best wishes for future success and enjoyment."
rjOjPJvE,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Village in May,Joe Hisaishi,La tarentelle,J.F.F.Burgmuller,81,"The performance of The Village in May was bright, clean and energised from the start. The tempo was brisk, but largely well maintained, just leaving room for tigher rhythmic control during the triplet figures and some of the dotted rhythms. The textures were well balanced and phrases moved with a sense of direction - lines were arched. There was scope for the dynamic range to be more varied, but the general mood created was joyful and fitting.  The opening was largely well coordinated in La Tarantelle. As the piece progressed there were parts that needed to be more precisely together, but the melodic line was confidently balanced in tone. The performance was buoyant and well defined in pulse. There needed to be more contrast between forte and piano markings, though there was some effective shaping, with the ending particularly well controlled and communicative.  There was an excellent sense of poise when playing, and a clear sense of involvement was conveyed, as lines were clean and confidently balanced. The pieces were well contrasted in character, though there was scope for the individual stylistic nuances and expressive components to be much more vibrant and purposeful. Although there needed to be more rhythmic control and tighter coordination in parts of the programme, the technical demands overall were largely well met.  Thank you for playing - I really enjoyed how well balanced the parts were throughout the programme, and that your pieces were very different in style."
rlQkElWD,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Sonatina Op.55 No.3,F. Kuhlau,Toccata,A. Khachaturian,94,"Kuhlau’s ’Sonatina’ was beautifully managed in terms of colour and phrasing, a vivid sense of elegance and neatness achieved throughout. Scope to manage the louder chordal parts more gracefully remained, the voicing and touch a little less persuasive in those moments, but this was otherwise a definitive rendition.  Detail and dexterity were consistent features through the Khachaturian, the character and style of the work eloquently portrayed, with rhythmic rigour and precision. In the ’andante espressivo’ section there was opporunity for more poise and flexiblitiy in the approach, with the textural challenges a little less well met through the lower legato passages. Regardless, it was still an exciting, authoritative account.  A thoroughly accomplished performance, both pieces vividly stylised and supported by outstanding technical skill. There was room for more performance awareness as each piece concluded, a longer moment of stillness was needed to allow the music to more meaningfully embed. Nonetheless your approach was confident and personally involved throughout.  Captivating playing, I was thoroughly impressed by the range of technical skill and musicianship conveyed through your performance. You have already achieved great heights, and I sincerely hope many others have the opportunity to hear your insightful performances in the future. Bravo!"
rpJOygqq,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Mouvement de valse,Louise Farrenc,Moon River,Arranged by Carolyn Miller,78,"The Farrenc was neatly paced so that the lilting waltz style came across, and there was a little ebb and flow in the tempo which suited it well. Quicker rhythms were not fully steady but top lines were well projected over a light accompaniment, with some buoyancy in the articulation. Dynamic range was relatively limited but there was a feel for the shape, and positive, accurate continuity.  ""Moon River"" flowed convincingly with support from the pedal. Notes were secure despite a little unease in the rhythm at phrase ends. Contrasts brought some shape to the playing, revealing awareness of the lyrical style, though these sometimes needed to be more evenly graded. Tempo and pedal were a little disruptive, especially at the end where there was a blemish, but you caught the evocative mood of the song.   You communicated the diverse styles of these two pieces well, within a narrow but clearly contrasted expressive range, and played with momentum and character despite some brief technical jogs along the way.   I enjoyed hearing your playing, and wish you well in your continued piano studies."
vJMqJljN,10-12,Up to Grade 5,"Etude Op.100 No.3, Pastorale",Burgmuller,Ticklin' Toes,Florence B. Price,72,"'Pastorale' captured the necessary 'dolce' from the start, with some of the lilting rhythm displayed. Even bolder phrase shapes and further detail were possible, however, and focus slightly waned at one point. Although more rhythmic playfulness and expression needed to find a voice, forward flow was sustained, with a gentle mood evoked.  Articulation achieved variety, and 'Ticklin' Toes' was approached with energy. A wider range of colour and further rhythmic playfulness were desirable, despite this, together with more spontaneity. Hesitation was present which weakened the conviction of the playing, but the tone retained clarity, and the ending sounded suitably bold and decisive.  Tempo choices were well judged in this performance, with effective contrast in mood achieved between the two interpretations. Even so, there was scope for bolder changes in colour and mood, and rhythmic integrity was not always assured. Further engagement in the music was required, and it was possible for melodies to sing with more expression. The tone retained clarity, nonetheless, with a good range of articulation employed, and vitality was communicated.  Real excitement and conviction were commanded in the closing moments of your final piece which provided a brilliant finish to the presentation. Let's hear more of this. Well done!"
vMBmlJwj,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Rhapsody in G Minor Op.79 No.2,J. Brahms,Over The Bars,J.P. Johnson,94,"The Brahms Rhapsody had a sense of flow and direction and the tempo was suitably lively. A little more tonal awareness would have been welcome, as rather more warmth could have been found at times. An even wider dynamic range could have been explored, especially the softer sounds, to give an air of mystery, and there was a little smudging in the delivery. More lyrical passages had shaping though and overall the account was exciting and dramatic, with a clear sense of musical involvement and conviction. Super!  Over the Bars began subtly and at quite a steady pace. The tone had brightness and definition though, and the toe-tapping character soon became evident, and was well communicated. The hands were well balanced and some of the left hand detailing was conveyed towards the end. Rhythmic patterns remained precise and defined and the note placing was largely well controlled and secure. A bright and spirited account with a clear sense of engagement and communication.  The playing displayed technical accomplishment and facility and the contrasting pieces showed musical awareness and sensitivity. The first piece was grandiose and dramatic and the second much more jaunty and rhythmic. This was an exceptional and engaging performance. Bravo!"
vZyZLyEe,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Enchanted Waterfall,Martha Mier,The Four variation on a Theme by Paganini,Victor Labunski,76,"’Enchanted Waterfall’ had a confident tone and projected melody, with careful lyrical and dynamic shaping - though room for much quieter playing at times. Parts were neatly coordinated, with mostly fluid rhythmic semiquaver figures, and defined flourishes. Chords were neatly placed, with fleeting blemishes and untidy moments not disruptive; scope for more time overall, particularly between phrases, but this was fluent and characterful.  ’Four Variations’ began assuredly, with crisp articulation and mostly rhythmic semiquavers. The first variation had confident momentum and secure quick passages - though fleeting untidiness between hands later on; the second variation had clear triplets and a bold, steady pulse. The opening of variation three had neatly placed chords, but rhythmic inaccuracy in some bars significantly unsettled the pulse - though this settled later, with some fiery energy. The final variation flowed musically, though pulse and rhythms were unsteady, with frequent errors and untidiness. Much wider dynamic range was needed overall, but this was spirited with a bold ending.  There was commitment in this performance, with some careful musical details - though dynamic range was generally limited. Technical details were partially secure, but with untidy moments and unstable rhythms and pulse in the second piece. Overall there was reliable continuity here.  I particularly liked the opening of the Labunski, where your bold rhythmic clarity suited the style of the piece."
vamGdKEL,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Sonatina in C Major- 1st Movement,Aram Kachaturian,"Scherzo (3rd movt from Sonata in A, D959)",Franz Peter Schubert,90,"The Kachaturian had vibrant energy, with assured clarity in semiquaver passages, and a bold staccato bass line. Careful musical details and phrasing throughout, with well-judged musical flexibility; sometimes the pulse became slightly rushed, with fleeting hurried, untidy rhythms and less controlled coordination between hands. Scope for a wider range of quiet dynamics; but sections were varied in mood, with imaginative shape and characterful direction throughout.  The Schubert began with bright staccato chords and confident, graceful momentum, with fluidity and clarity in extended semiquavers. The pulse was not always quite secure, with some hurried and unrhythmic moments; small blemishes were not disruptive, but there was occasional untidiness between parts, and less reliable clarity in some thickly textured passages. The middle section was sustained and musically shaped, with contrasted tone and mood - though melodic lines were sometimes overshadowed, with chords not always neatly placed. Scope for wider dynamic range overall, but there was assured continuity and stylistic energy here.  This was a poised and thoughtfully paced performance; different styles were communicated with careful musical phrasing and articulation - though scope for a quieter dynamic spectrum at times. Technical details were secure, apart from occasional blemishes and untidiness, and moments of unsteadiness in rhythms and pulse; overall this was an assured and fluent presentation.  I particularly liked the characterful energy and clarity you conveyed in the Kachaturian."
vkrRLDar,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Waltz in B Minor,Franz Schubert,Vivace Assai from XII petite pieces,Joseph Hadyn,78,"The ’Waltz’ element was well communicated in the Schubert, conveyed in the apt artiuclation of the left hand and the well judged tempo. The accompaniment tended to be the more prominent voice in the balance, and there were a few inaccurate notes in the chords there. Greater variety of shape and colour would have enhnaced its expressive effect, but there was a general sense of elegance.  Colour was well varied in the Haydn, giving effect to musical contrasts, with the articulation often suitably graceful in effect. This was less true of some louder moments, with some of the faster moving parts less well coordinated and balanced. Nearly all of the notes were safely in place though and it was a fluent, characterful account as a whole.  There was a genuine sense of determination and focus through this performance. Management of the sheet music, and of the pacing, could have been more carefully done and enhanced the overall feeling of performance awareness. The roles of each hand also needed more consistent definition, but a grasp of the different musical styles was clearly conveyed, with overall security in their delivery also achieved.  This was very good playing! I particularly admire how elegantly you managed much of the articulation in both your pieces. I hope this very good result gives you the confidence to perform more often in the future, and to gain more experience in communicating to an audience. Good luck!"
vqgzQGro,7-9,Grade 5 and above,The Little Ballerina,Christian Hartman,Le Petit Ane Blanc (The Little White Donkey),Jacques Ibert,92,"The Little Ballerina, saw effective use of rubato, and throughout, it was played with a sense of grace.  The melodic figures sang brightly, although occasionally the accompanying chords were a little prominent in the texture.  However, although there was scope for even more fluency on occasion, this was a musical and accurate rendition.  The lively tempo of 'The Little White Donkey' was apparent from the outset, the staccato left hand accompaniment very well managed, and later dynamic contrasts gave musical outline to the programmatic quality.  There was scope for greater use of the quieter dynamic levels on occasion, and a couple of slips of pitch placement, together with one early entry occurred in the central section.  However, this was a technically secure and characterful account.    The contrasts of style were musically conveyed in this assured performance, with clear stylistic engagement in place, and with the performance situation extremely well managed.  Throughout, you played with technical assurance and maturity, making the performance a pleasure to watch.  Many congratulations on this exceptional performance.  I particularly enjoyed your characterisation of the differing pieces."
vrJBaora,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Wind in the Willows,Bernadette Marmion,In the Groove,Mike Cornick,79,"’Wind in the Willows’ flowed musically at the start, with a lyrical melody - though slightly less fluid legato later on. The tempo was generally steady at first, with careful rhythmic control; the pulse wavered at times, with slips and hesitations sometimes unsettling the flow, and moments of untidiness between parts. Overall there was sensitive warmth here, with some dynamic shaping and the mood captured.  ’In the Groove’ had a clear tone and steady continuity; the opening was cautious at first, but momentum soon became more settled and assured. A few blemishes and hesitations were not too intrusive, though there were occasionally unsteady rhythms; chords were firmly placed, with some dynamic shaping, and the cheerful jazzy style conveyed.  This was a generally fluent performance, with some musical details and engagement with different styles. Technical details were mainly reliable, but errors and hesitations were sometimes slightly unsettling; overall there was sensitivity and continuity here.  I particularly liked your carefully placed chords and firm accents in the Cornick."
vrbqNVpm,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Ticklin' Toes,Florence B. Price,Billie's Song: No.7 from Portraits in Jazz,Valerie Capers,76,"’Ticklin’ Toes’ was well paced, the lively tempo effectively sustained. It could have afforded further precision and coordination in its individual rhythms, with the second half generally less varied in terms of musical interest. Still there was only one note slip and the articulation remained suitably buoyant.  Note accuracy and overall fluency were both consistent strengths through ’Billie’s Song’. For a more expressive effect, the rhythms needed a less measured quality, especially at the end, with room to voice the chords to allow the melody to sing more clearly in the texture. Whilst not shapely, an overall sense of legato helped to capture the musical mood convincingly.  This was a technically accomplished performance, and a clear sense of determination was apparent in your approach. The expressive elements of both pieces could have been more clearly defined, but this was partly achieved through the apt use of articulation which showed a grasp of the different moods.  Well done! I hope this very good result gives you a deserved sense of confidence as you continue your musical journey, and the drive to explore the more expressive nuances the Piano offers. Keep performing!"
wBXJvOJB,10-12,Up to Grade 5,ester’s Jig: No. 7 from A Royal Birthday Celebration: Suite in Baroque Style,Chee-Hwa Tan,Love Theme,Catherine Rollin,88,"The character of Jester’s Jig was well captured from the start, with bright, fluent phrases, which were energised and clean. There was some effective use of articulation and phrases flowed with a positive sense of pulse, for the most part, though there was room for tighter control and more precise coordination in places. Whilst there was scope for more vibrant shaping and involvement, the phrases moved with a sense of direction.   Atmospheric and lyrical, the phrases within the Love Theme were smooth and expressive, and suitably flexible in relation to the style. The pedal was well managed and the shaping was idiomatic and communicative. Tone was only occasionally harsh, and there was room for the ending to be even more stretched in relation to flow, but this was a vivid and committed performance.  This was consistently clean and well controlled, with a strong sense of poise when playing and between the individual items. There was a clear contrast between the two pieces, though they varied in their musical portrayal: the first piece had scope to be more stylistically vivid and nuanced, though the second was communicative throughout. The technical demands of the programme were largely met with positivity.   The second piece was a real highlight! Thank you for playing."
wGmNoadd,16-18,Grade 5 and above,New Kid,Christopher Norton,Tempo di minuetto,Marianne von Martinez,68,"A bright and lively tempo was adopted at the start of ’New Kid’, and the rhythmic patterns were precise and defined. There a little hesitation in places and rather more buoyancy and energy could have been found here. There were a couple of stumbles en route and also a little rhythmic instability, but the line was maintained and something of the character was conveyed.  The opening of the Minuet was well projected, but the tempo was on the safe side and the rhythmic patterns were not quite precise and secure. The semiquaver passages were mostly even and defined and showed finger agility. The Minuet style was not fully realised at this pace but there were signs of dynamic detailing and shaping in the phrases, and the account showed musical intent.  The choice of pieces was suitably contrasted and there were signs of musical awareness in the detailing employed in the presentation. Rather more buoyancy and lift could have been found in both pieces, and also a greater sense of outward presentation. However, there was much to commend and admire, well done on your performance!"
wJLEyovx,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Jester's Jig,Chee-Hwa Tan,In the Groove,Mike Cornick,81,"Jester’s Jig skipped along with a bright tone and largely clear sense of the music’s cheery mood. Note slips appeared from time to time, and there was scope to vary the dynamic range more enterprisingly. The tempo was ideally chosen and maintained, with much of the fingerwork tidily controlled.  In the Groove demonstrated a good level of conviction and vitality, with syncopations mostly well delivered and a suitably gauged speed confidently sustained throughout. An occasional smudged note and less natural sounding rhythmic moment occurred, and there was the possibility of extra variety of effect, to help give each section an even clearer identitiy. The playing was spirited and brought out the jazzy style with a bold attack.  The two pieces contrasted well, showing a sturdy level of technical control and confidence with the styles. While isolated inaccuracies in notes occurred, and still greater contrasts proved possible, the playing overall demonstrated excellent musicality.  Congratulations, and very best wishes for your onward musical journey!"
wKlzvXBJ,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Tarantella Twist,Victoria Proudler,Always with me,"Youmi kimura, words by wakako kaku",74,"Tarantella Twist began with a decisive sense of flow and direction, and you played with considerable energy at the start. The rhythmic control wasn’t fully even however, and some bumpiness in the the flow occurred, also affecting the regularity of tempo at times, though the ending held a more convincing sense of flair.  Always with Me by contrast was tender and smooth in its delivery and you captured a warm feeling for the piece’s mood. This was a well-directed account, mostly well-grounded rhythmically, but just with scope for more natural integration of the ritenuto at the end. Otherwise this was a sincere account.  Your playing revealed sensitivity and character, and you engaged with the styles and moods of both works with conviction. There was a good feeling of poise in the presentation, and while rhythmical consistency wasn’t reliable in the opening work, greater security of technical control was achieved latterly.  Congratulations on these vividly defined performances!"
wMDkEOGE,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Sonata in B minor, K. 27",Domenico Scarlatti,Lyrical Waltz (from Dances of the Dolls),Dmitri Shostakovich,85,"The Scarlatti flowed securely, with a warm tone and reliable rhythmic clarity in passagework - though not always clear voicing where the left hand crossed over. Parts were mainly coordinated, but not consistently - though melodic entries were clear in all parts, with phrases musically shaped. Effective musical flexibility here, though there was slightly waning assurance and direction at times. Scope for more varied tone and articulation, but there was some careful dynamic shaping and effectively tapered phrase ends.  The Shostakovich conveyed graceful waltz momentum, with effective flexibility between phrases and reliable rhythmic control. A few slightly hesitant moments and small blemishes in the middle, with scope for more assurance and direction in bolder moments. Melodic passages had clarity, with careful phrasing and coordinated hands; there was room for wider dynamic range, and more varied articulation, especially lighter chords - but this was characterful and fluent.  This was a poised performance, with different styles communicated through careful musical details and lyrical shaping. Secure technical control here, with reliable rhythms and pulse - apart from fleeting blemishes and untidiness; overall this was a consistently fluent, musical presentation.  I particularly liked the light waltz mood you conveyed in the Shostakovich."
wdkAEolY,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Notturno Op. 54-4,E.H. Grieg,Novelette in B flat minor,Francis Poulenc,82,"Grieg’s Notturno was gently lilting in tempo, and the expressive shape of the music was well understood. Balance bewteen hands sometimes lacked careful consideration, with over-prioritisation of accompanying chords, and not all the quieter playing was quite sparkling enough. Howeever, pedalling was well mangaed and the end was especially conclusive.   Novelette was immediately contrasting in style and rhythmic approach, and the playful mood was firmly captured. There was occasional unevenness of triplets and scope for a much more forensic evaluation of both articulation and dynamic detail. However, there was a clear feeling of enjoyment and urgency.  This was an effectively paced performance, demonstrating stylistic understanding, and tempo choices were carefully made. There was room for even more of the refined musical detail to add further sparkle, but your enjoyment and determination was always apparent.  This was an excellent performance-well done. Best wishes for future success and enjoyment."
wwkJdvqJ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,No. 23 in F Major from 24 Jazz Preludes Op. 53,Nikolai Kapustin,Clair de lune,Claude Debussy,89,"The jazz style of the Prelude was evident from the outset, subtle tonal shaping of the melodic phrases giving clear direction to the line, and with the contrasts of textural style defined. There were times across the course of the piece when greater flexibiity of both tone and tempo would have enhanced the relaxed character, particularly in the central sections. However, with just the occasional blemish of evenness in some of the faster rhythmic passages, this was accurately played, with use of a reasonably wide dynamic range.  The quiet opening of the Debussy helped to give a sense of its ethereal and atmospheric character, and throughout the piece, subtle tonal shaping supported the melodic outline, textural voicing assured.  Just occasionally, chordal playing lost evenness and accuracy of pitch placement, particularly in the widest chords. However, rubato was appropriate in its use, and despite increased harmonic blurring and some pitch blemish latterly, this was a musical account in which the melody largely projected securely.  A confident performance in which the contrasting styles of the two pieces were tonally defined. Throughout, you played with clear projection of involvement, even if further stylistic engagement was possible in the Kapustin, and despite the occasional blemish, delivery showed a high degree of accuracy together with musical understanding.  Congratulations on this excellent playing, musical conviction evident throughout. I particularly enjoyed the atmospheric opening of the Debussy."
wxMqMkRz,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Allegro: first movement from Sonatina in C, Op.20 No.1",Friedrich Kuhlau,"Indigo Moon: from Pepperbox Jazz, Book 2",Elissa Milne,80,"The Sonatine movement was played with appropriate tonal brightness, the melodic phrases seeing suitable rounding. Wider dynamic contrasts were made, and although some phrases saw slight slowing, particularly as semiquavers were negotiated, fingerwork retained evenness and clarity of articulation, only the recapitulation showing more pointed variation of pulse. Overall, this was an accurate and tonally assured account.  ’Indigo Moon’ saw some flexibility of both tone and tempo, its haunting quality largely realised. There was scope for further width of dynamic range, quieter playing not always even, and rhythms were not always fully precise, with a couple of pitch slips in the left hand during the second half. However, the overall style of the music was clearly in place, and melodic projection was securely maintained.  Overall, this was a poised performance which saw appropriate time between the two items, and with focus maintained. Further projection of musical involvement would have enhanced the sense of stylisitc engagement, although the contrasts of style were found, and despite occasional blemish, you played with conviction.  Congratulations on this excellent performance. I especially enjoyed the contrasts of tone quality between the two pieces, fitting to their styles."
xAYJPvWJ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Last Song,Alexis Ffrench,Etude Op.25 No.2 in F minor,Chopin,90,"’Last Song’ was expressively played, using both tonal variation and controlled rubato to shape the line, a good degree of exploration of tone qualities made. Occasionally the melody lost projection when at the top of harmonic intervals, and there was sometimes room for further harmonic clarity. However, the legato style was consistently maintained, supported by largely confident pedal use.    The Chopin Prelude saw appropriate tonal brightness in the melody, with nuanced tonal graduation reflecting its outline. Further tonal lightness would have supported its programmatic character, and greater textural clarity was necessary. However, the moments of tempo flexibility and release of the sustaining pedal were refreshing, with accuracy consistent in this confident account.    Musical intention was clear throughout this performance, the contrasting styles musically defined and with focus evident. There was scope for greater projection of sylistic engagement, your face not visible, but you played with an air of confidence and composure.    Many congratulations on this exceptional performance, your technical security and tonal range highlights, and with expression in the Ffrench beautifully controlled."
xKNzlbam,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Alla Turca,W.A.Mozart,Il Porco Rosso,Joe Hisaishi,79,"The fingerwork was light and bright at the start of the Mozart Rondo and the semiquavers were mostly even and defined, and tripped along merrily. The octave sections were not quite so tidy but the notes were secure and there were clear contrasts in tone quality and dynamics. The tempo was not quite consistent and there was some loss of rhythmic incisiveness in the final dotted patterns. The account had a clear sense of style and direction, and the presentation was engaging.  Il Porco Rosso was suitably steady and restrained and the gentle lyricism of the piece was conveyed. The left hand chords had some tonal depth and the melodic line had touches of a cantabile tone. The rhythmic patterns were evident but were a little overworked, and a greater sense of flow and momentum would have been welcome, especially in the larger chordal sections. The rubato styling could have been further explored, and a greater overall sense of fluidity to convey the narrative. The line was maintained though, and something of the relaxed style was portrayed.  The pieces selected were suitably varied and the detailing and nuanced ideas where effective in realising the styles. There was a little reserve in the sense of communication, and a greater sense of outward presentation would have been welcome. However, the playing showed technical facility and musical awareness. Very well done."

Timothy Brown",67,"The pulse retained focus in the ’Arabesque’, with a bright tone captured. Uneven fast figures were audible, however, and there was room for a wider range of colour and dynamics, though forward flow proved secure.  Articulation achieved variety, and there was bounce in the touch during the Paganini arrangement. Despite this, further shape and detail were desirable, with greater rhythmic vitality necessary, as well as focus at times. Although a note was unclean in sound, some contrast between the sections was displayed.  Both pieces were approached with energy, but control was not always assured, and more variety in mood and tempo was desirable in this selection. Forward flow remained confident, nonetheless, with a clear tone realised.  This performance displayed some delightful detail and a positive energy. Well done!"
xOjNqzlN,16-18,Grade 5 and above,Tarantella,A. Pieczonka,Etude in D flat,Louise Farrenc,87,"The introduction in the Tarantella was suitably lively and projected, and lead into this characterul and energetic account. The rhythmic patterns were precise and defined, and the changes in tempi were apt. There was some impressive brightness and brilliance in the right hand top notes and the hands were mostly balanced and coordinated. The middle, more lyrical section provided a clear contrast and the account had a sense of flow and direction. There were some overly harsh tones at times and a little more refinement in this section would have been wellcome. The reprise was suitably vigorous and the quicker passages were well defined, in this dramatic and vivacious interpretation.  Farrenc’s Etude had a sense of direction and flow at the start and the hands were balanced in favour of the melodic line. There was a little harshness in the tone at times and rather more warmth and cantabile would have been welcome. The phrases were given contouring and expression and touches of rubato were suitably employed. The double thirds were impressively managed and the hands were coordinated, and the style was well realised.  The chosen pieces had some contrast and the technical delivery was secure and reliable throughout. Greater tonal awareness and variety could have been explored but the stylistic detailing was effective. There was some most enjoyable lightness in the fingerwork in the Tarantella and there was much to commend in the overall performance. Well done!"
xYJwKbNZ,13-15,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3 No. 2",Sergei Rachmaninoff,Thine Own,Gustav Lange,94,"The Rachmaninoff was tackled with much conviction and the chords were cleanly struck. A vivid dynamic range was conveyed and the change of tempo was well judged. The rapid chords in the ’Agitato’ section were not always precisely placed but the melodic line projected effectively through the dense textures. Pedalling was well gauged and rubato was instinctively integrated into the phrasing in this authoritative account.  A rich but clearly defined tone was conveyed in ’Thine Own’, with the melody being carefully highlighted for the most part, albeit with a slightly overweigted chordal accompaniment on occasions. The split octave work was tidily negotiated and the phrases were contoured with apt spaciousness and breadth. There were occasional minor note blemishes and it had scope for just a little more exploration of the softer tone colours, but the climactic moments were suitably full-blooded and the running embellishments were executed with due panache.  The programme was presented in a confident and professional manner, appropriate space being afforded in between the two pieces. There was a convincing level of technical agility and rhythmical security, albeit with just the occasional brief area of unease. The musical styles were well understood, with a rich tone being provided at the moments of intensity, if having a little further opportunity for some gentler contrasting tone colours. However the performance as a whole was fully committed and persuasively communicated.  Congratulations on a very fine all round performance!"
xaAQwPAG,7-9,Up to Grade 5,"VENUS, LAND OF MYSTERY",CATHERINE ROLLIN,TOCCATA RITMICO,DENNIS ALEXANDER,77,"Venus, Land of Mystery began at a suitable tempo with the sustaining pedal warming the tone and helping to establish the character, although indicated pedal changes were sometimes missed. The LH quavers flowed evenly in the main, although there was room to shape and colour the phrases more fully in these more lyrical sections. The semiquaver flourishes were well managed, with the tempo markings incorporated and effectively judged.  Toccata Ritmico had a sense of energy from the outset, and the changes in meter were convincingly presented. There was room to make more of the dynamic contrasts, particularly in the more lyrical middle section, which could have had a stronger sense of shape, but this was characterful and spirited playing overall.  This was an engaging and well contrasted programme, effectively sequenced and paced.  Delivery was largely controlled and, despite there being room for stronger dynamic colouring, the playing was characterful, with a sense of communication overall.  Congratulations on a very good performance."

L'Estrange",Berry's Smoothie,Nikki Yeoh,80,"There was a lovely legato feel to Remember Me and the melodic line was cantabile. Although further expressive shaping of phrases and more sense of direction was possible at times the tenderness of this lullaby really came across.  Crisp staccato detail and a firm pulse suited the character of Berry's Smoothie, and there was a jaunty feel if more drive and energy possible overall. There was room for more accent detail and dynamic contrast to really animate the style however the tone was bright and the notes very assured.  There was a poise and precision in the playing of this programme and the contrasting characters of the chosen pieces were well conveyed  although slightly quicker tempo choices would have given more sense of momentum and direction to the playing in each piece.  Your attention to the musical details supported a sensitive performance of Remember Me - well done."
xjPPbXJb,16-18,Up to Grade 5,Etude in E Minor,Stephen Heller,Arirang,Alan Bullard,71,"The Heller was presented at a bright pace and began lightly, providing a good foundation for dynamic light and shade. As the playing progressed, there was a good balance of bold, emphatic projection and subtler textures. The pedal supported well, but there were some moments of less precise technical delivery, affecting note accuracy or rhythmic evenness, though rarely continuity. Articulation ensured plenty of character in the playing.   ""Arirang"" was poignantly presented, its lyrical qualities often well communicated. Most of the notes were accurately in place, and there was a good feel for the flowing nature of the music, with plenty of dynamic variety. The expressive design did not always remain true to the music, though, and there were some misjudgements in terms of tempo, dynamic gradation and voicing. Nevertheless, the playing was considered and musical.   This was a vastly diverse programme and you took time to ensure each piece was presented in its own context, with good pacing. Tempo and expressive choices did not always convince, and there was some technical unease along the way, but the communciaiton of character was generally successful and textures were often well managed.   Thank you for sharing your plaing, and I wish you continued enjoyment and fulfillment in your music."
yAjlmZlo,13-15,Up to Grade 5,The Village in May,Joe Hisaishi,Hook's Hornpipe,Nikki Iles,81,"’The Village in May’ flowed with musical charm and mainly coordinated parts. The pulse in the melodic section was generally solid, with a firm bass line, and reliable rhythmic clarity in the melody - apart from a few isolated blemishes and fleeting hesitations, and occasionally wavering direction through some phrases. Scope for wider dynamic variety, but this had characterful momentum.  ’Hook’s Hornpipe’ had bright energy and neatly placed chords. Generally assured and reliable flow, but repeated chords were often slightly hurried, unsettling the pulse. Legato sections were contrasted in mood, but chords were not always neatly placed, with scope for more dynamic variety. A few slips and untidy moments were not disruptive, and this had characterful direction.  This was a focused performance, with well-paced transitions between styles and careful musical details - though room for wider dynamic range, particularly quieter moments. Technical details were secure, apart from fleeting untidness and unsteady rhythms; overall this was fluent and assured.  I particularly enjoyed your bold, assertive bass line through the Hisaishi."
yEbGvzAl,10-12,Grade 5 and above,Rumores de la Caleta,Isaac Albéniz,Alla Turca,W.A. Mozart,74,"The Albeniz began with crisply articulated rhythms at a lively tempo.

In the recitative passages there was room to develop a stronger personal connection to the piece as well as a wider tonal range of dynamic and colour, but there was some effective spacing to the phrasing.  There was much sparkling fingerwork in place in the Mozart and the tempo was well-chosen. Some loss of pace did occur in the central passagework and final part, whilst the octaves were not always deftly articulated, slightly marring the flow of these sections. An effective use of dynamics and accents gave this bright character.  Both pieces had clear commitment and there was a calm feel to the performance, attaining a clear sense of the character of each.  I enjoyed the contrasts of the programme. Well done on some very good playing."
yJAWDxEM,10-12,Grade 5 and above,"Prelude and Fugue in B-flat, BWV 866",J. S. Bach,"Allegro: first movement from Sonata in F, K. 332",W. A. Mozart,80,"Confident pacing of Bach’s ’Prelude’ was an laudable feature, with the rhythms neatly managed almost throughout. The pedalling in the more chordal phrases slightly impacted tonal purity, with more clarity of phrasing and balancing needed across the Fugue to give it an expressive effect, the different voices not consistently well defined in their roles. Nonetheless it was fully fluent and assured in its notes.  Mozart’s Sonata had positive rhythmic impetus and a variety of articulation. That said, it generally needed a more distinct sense of elegance and poise to genuinely reflect the musical style. There were moments when tonal clarity and warmth was lost, mostly in louder pedalled parts, with room to manage the ornaments more tidily also. It still remained very secure in terms of both fluency and melodic accuracy.  An admirable performance, with dexterous fingerwork a strength across both pieces. Characterisation could have been stronger, more awareness of balancing and different tonal possibilities would have assisted in this regard. Further rhythmic nuance and poise would also have given a more convincing sense of musical insight in the Mozart, but your approach remained fully focussed and committed throughout.  Well done! An excellent performance which showcased your commendable technical skill. Wishing you every success in your future musical endeavours!"
yPPVvXlq,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Muss i denn,Trad. German Arranged by David Blackwell,A Song of Erin,Thomas Dunhill,79,"This was a well chosen tempo for the German song, with variety in articulation achieved. Further detail and shape were possible, however, together with a little more flexibility in the touch at times, though graded dynamics proved effective. Forward flow remained confident, with some poetry sensed.  The tone sounded natural and unforced in ’A Song of Erin’, with the pulse focused. Bolder contrast between the sections was desirable, despite this, with further finesse awaiting discovery. Although the playing was a little one-coloured at times, some buoyancy was captured, as well as vitality.  Assured forward flow featured in both interpretations, and there was an ability to vary dynamics. Even so, greater contrast between the two pieces was necessary, as both were songs in a similar lyrical vein. An even wider range of colour and expression were possible, though the essential legato phrasing was realised.  There was good technical control sustained, and you have a delightful, playful sense of rhythm that supported the well chosen tempi and assured flow. Keep up the good work!"
yRmQdZpJ,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Love Theme,Catherine Rollin,"Theme, Var. 1 and Var. 5",Mozart,83,"The mood of the Love Theme was well captured from the start, with smooth and sensitively shaped phrases. The pedal was largely well controlled and the textures were balanced, with just the need for greater cohesion between some phrases. Whilst there was room for the lyrical and expressive components of the piece to be even more vivid, the performance was atmospheric and positive, with the ending particularly well controlled and communicative.   The Mozart began with a bright, clean tone, and hands were well coordinated. The melodic line was confidently projected, though the ornamentation needed more precision. Phrases moved with a sense of direction, though there was scope for greater variation and stylistic nuances. The playing was fluent.   The performance was poised, and there was some effective pacing between the individual pieces. Textures were confidently balanced and the hands worked well together. The interpretations were communicative and captured the moods, but just left room for even more vibrant and expressive portrayal. The technical demands of the programme were met with positivity.   I particularly enjoyed the calm and peaceful mood created within the first piece - well done!"
yWVQlDoY,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Pentatonic Tune,Béla Bartók,Allegro In F,G.F.Handel,87,"Pentatonic Tune began with well coordinated hands, and the phrases were both energised and given room to breathe. The articulation was crisp and there was some clear use of dynamic. In parts, there was some loss of clarity within the melodic line and the textures had room to be even more balanced, particularly when the tune was in the left hand line. Although some phrases towards the end were not fully cohesive, the playing overall was committed and captured the rhythmic buoyancy and character well.  The second piece was bold in tone, moving with a reliable sense of pulse too. There was some effective shaping and dynamic direction, with some carefully considered and stylistic use of articulation - though this was not always consistently applied. There was scope for more interplay between the hands and there was some inconsistency of tone control, but the notes remained accurate in pitch and lines were clean and well balanced.  There was a strong sense of poise and control when playing, with well organised pacing between the two pieces. The different characters came across effectively, with some communicative musical details, just leaving room for even more vivid and vibrant portrayal overall. There was some inconsistency of tone control, but the rhythmic components of the programme were robust, with the technical demands overall, met with positivity.  I particularly enjoyed the rhythmic character that was captured throughout this programme - well done."
yWzNbvkL,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Grandes Etudes de Paganini “La Chasse”,Franz Liszt,O Polichinello,Villa Lobos,92,"There was strong tempo control, tempered by a little flexibility, which brought out the contrasts and colours of the various phrases of the Liszt. Sections also contrasted well and there was good characterisation of the ’imitations’ of orchetsral instruments and of the general tonal range. Not all of the projection was successfully clear, and there was some untidiness within rhythm and note placement, but the delivery had insight and authenticity, and was underpinned by a sense of flamboyance that suited the music.  The Villa-Lobos was bright and energetic with lots of lightness and impetus despite some fleeting stumbles and losses of focus in the sound along the way. A very wide dynamic range was in use and this ensured a compelling and engaging account, always positive and with stable pulse. You included lots of emphasis and gradation, allowing for adept and insightful pacing that was fitting for such a colourful piece.  As a performance this was convincing in terms of technical dexterity, despite untidy corners and scope for more consistency of projection, and it was musical in terms of expressive design and communication. You brought a personal approach to the interpretation which worked for the music, and though both pieces in the programme were showy, flamboyant works, there was sufficient control and contrast in both to set them apart.  Your playing was engaging and enjoyable to watch and listen to. Thank you for sharing it, and my best wishes for continued success and fulfilment in your musical studies."
yYjPoBRX,10-12,Up to Grade 5,A Distant Star in the Stillness,David A. T. Önac,In the Groove,Mike Cornick,69,"A Distant Star in the Stillness began sensitively at a suitable tempo and was melodically accurate throughout, with some colourful dynamic contrasts helping to bring the music to life.  Rhythms were not always accurately realised, though, with longer notes often shortened, upsetting the stability of the pulse.  The sustaining pedal warmed the tone and there were some musical and thoughtful moments.  In the Groove began at a brisk pace and was played with energy and buoyancy throughout.  Not all was completely secure, with a few melodic and rhythmic errors, but the character was captured overall, with some cleanly defined articulation, despite a little unevenness of flow in places.  A spirited account.  This was a clearly committed and engaging performance, with the two contrasting styles effectively characterised through a wide range of dynamics and articulation.  Rhythmic imprecision and a few melodic errors compromised the delivery, particularly in the first part of the performance, but there was a sense of communication overall.  A good performance - well done."
yeomdDqb,13-15,Up to Grade 5,Path Of The Wind (My Neighbor Totoro),Joe Hisaishi,The Egyptian Magician (Humoresque),M.Levine,79,"There was a sensitive opening in ’Path of the Wind’, and a broad range of tonal colour was achieved as the piece developed. Right hand material generally needed further projection, particularly in the early stages and when the main theme began. Phrasing could have been more defined overall, but aside from one rhythmic hesitation near a cadence in the second half, it was fluent playing and had a smooth legato.  Well defined musical contrasts helped to convey the character of ’The Egyptian Magician’, supported by a well judged tempo. Rhythmically it could have afforded more neatness and precision, particularly in quieter and faster moving parts. There was opporunity to find a clearer sense of direction in the phrases that began quietly too, but the notes were assuredly managed and it was committed playing.  A clear sense of focus was sustained through the programme, leaving room for even more poise at the end of the first piece, to allow the music to more meaningfully embed. More assured control of phrasing, faster rhythms and balancing would have brought even more clarity to each piece, but their different musical moods were clearly conveyed nonetheless.  Well done! This was very good playing which demonstrated your clear understanding of different musical styles. I hope you go forward with a renewed sense of confidence, and continue to share your musical abilities with others in future performances!"
ynEWnlda,10-12,Up to Grade 5,The Singing Swan,Alexis Ffrench,"Moderato: first movement from Sonatina in G, WoO Anh. 5",Ludwig van Beethoven,83,"A delicate feeling of ambience was immediately communicated at the start of The Swinging Swan, and you paced this well.  The flow was evenly managed and the melody projected with warmth for the most part.  There was space for greater fluidity and shape in the lines to draw out more of the music's expressive quality, but you captured something of the tender mood.  The first movement of Beethoven's Sonatina was well-defined, with attentive articulation and slurring bringing detail to the theme.  A little more rhythmic lift and flexibility of contour would have added to the character of the music, but this flowed with consistency, and note accuracy was fully reliable throughout.  Although a little more time and space was needed at the conclusion of each piece to allow the music to settle, you brought a good feeling of focus to the presentation while playing, and there was characterful definition in the performances.  More insight in the phrasing was possible, but the technical control was commendably secure.  Well done on such sensitively defined playing!"
yqgYvKnK,13-15,Grade 5 and above,Tarantella in A minor,Albert Pieczonka,Merry-Go-Round,Joe Hisaishi,94,"The energy and drama of the Tarantella came across strongly, with very brisk tempo choices well supported by adept and often compelling technical work. A lot of the right-hand quaver delivery was sparkling and well controlled, and there was bold projection throughout, highlighting very vivid contrasts and bringing much colour to the fore, which suited the musical narrative. There were moments of less clear textural or rhythmic work, and some of the expressive statements impeded the sense of line, but these were fleeting blemishes in a very exciting account.  The Hisaishi performance caught the lilting waltz-style, conjuring up the merry-go-round style and the colourful imagery associated with it. Phrases were supported by well directed, often emphatic and well articulated playing, and tempo management successfully highlighted changes of character and mood. There was scope for more precision in the most intricate moments, where rhythmic imbalance sometime affected clarity, and room for greater ’abandon’ in the more celebratory, louder sections which were slightly carefully couched. Notes and rhythms were mostly well managed, though, and there was always musical insight and convincing light and shade in the playing.  The performance was colourful and engaging throughout, and you paced the playing very thoughtfully, ensuring a strong cohesion and narrative moving through these two very different styles. There were good opportunities to show expressive understanding, and these were well taken and largely supported by technical security in what were two challenging pieces, though with some less focused moments creeping in, particularly in the closing stages of the performance. Instrument management was assured in terms of tone, balance and texture, with good pedal support.  Well done indeed, on achieving this assured and very musical performance. I enjoyed listening to and watching your playing very much."
ywMYYvJv,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Jester's Jig,Chee-Hwa Tan,Love Theme,Catherine Rollin,73,"Jester’s Jig was played at a lively tempo and although rhythmically all was not evenly controlled and there was variation in pulse, the tone remained bright and a sense of direction was largely sustained. There was the occasional glitch in the flow and less tidily controlled corner, but the dynamic detail was often present and the second section flowed more convincingly.  There was a legato flow to Love Theme and a graceful tempo overall although not all was fully persuasive in the flexibility of pace. Balance needed further consideration to allow the melodic line to sing out more consistently but the dynamic rise and fall was often effective.  The character of the chosen pieces was effectively contrasted and musical intentions conveyed, although more stillness between the pieces would have further enhanced the sense of performance.  I enjoyed your sensitivity to the musical mood of Love Song, where a sense of involvement in the playing was conveyed."
zJwooAyD,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Jesters Jig,Chee -Hwa Tan,Love Theme,Catherine Rollin,78,"The Jig was played at a bright pace and had plenty of forward momentum.  Several slips and untidy corners did mar the flow however but there was always musical line. Many effective accents were in place and the phrases had some convincing phrasing too.    A gentle atmosphere was created in the Love Theme, with expressive and natural phrasing creating the narrative. There was scope to build dynamics more strongly but there was a structure to the phrases. Occasional uneven tonal projection did occur but the accompaniment was sensitively balanced and pedalling added warmth.   This was a well-contrasted programme which had a clear sense of occasion in spite of the mishaps; there was a distinct sense of the differing characters of the pieces.   I enjoyed the presentation and varied musical energy. Well done on some very good playing."
zZKkPYJK,7-9,Up to Grade 5,Invention N.4 BWV 755,Johann Sebastian Bach,Sontina N.1 Op.55 1st movemennt,Friedrich Kuhlau,73,"A well chosen tempo for the Invention in D minor, and the pulse retained clarity. There was room for greater flexibility in the phrasing, however, with more fluidity and lightness desirable in both the trills. Further dialogue between the hands was possible, with the touch a little heavy at times which weakened the ability of the rhythms to dance. The semi-quaver notes remained even, nonetheless, with forward flow assured.  The Kuhlau ’Allegro’ possessed an appropriate bounce, and variation in articulation was achieved. The approach was rather one-coloured at times, despite this, with further variation between repeated phrases required. A more rigid touch was audible in one passage when dynamics were loud, with further shape and detail possible, but vitality was conveyed. A bright tone was captured, with the mood lively.  Sufficient contrast was achieved between the two chosen pieces, with some delightfully varied articulation displayed, though it was possible for melodies to sing with further detail and conviction. At times, the touch was too heavy or rigid which limited expression and the playfulness of the rhythms, though a little poetry was glimpsed at one point in the Sonatina when the mood was allowed to relax. Even so, plenty of bounce was conveyed, and co-ordination proved secure.  Your playing was full of energy, and an ability to sustain confident forward flow was never in doubt. Well done!"
zaaNvybl,10-12,Up to Grade 5,Vivace,Muzio Clementi,The Spanish Guitar,William Gillock,79,"Played at a sprightly pace with bright tone, there was some dynamic contrast between phrases and a mostly reliable pulse in the Clementi. Although the final phrases were less tidily controlled, the light RH articulation suited the style.  The Gillock showed a grasp of the rhythmic style with some purposeful dynamic contrast and a range of emphases. Triplet figures needed more energy in the articulation and not all the nuances of musical detail were fully realised, but a sense of the character was projected.  There was a poise in this presentation with musical intentions apparent and largely an assured fluency with effective contrast between the chosen styles.  I particularly enjoyed the positive rhythmic feel and tonal contrast in The Spanish Guitar."
